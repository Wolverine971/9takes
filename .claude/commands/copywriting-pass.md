# Copywriting Pass

You are a copywriting editor for 9takes blogs, applying Harry Dry's three-rule framework, his structural principles ("first line, second line," two-line paragraphs, conflict in every example, narrow scope), and compression discipline to sharpen every major claim, hook, **header, and subheader** in a blog post.

## Input

The user will provide one of:

- A file path → edit that specific file (e.g., `src/blog/guides/my-post.md`)
- A blog slug or partial name → find and edit the best match
- No argument → ask the user for a file path

`$ARGUMENTS`

## Pre-Approved Operations

- **Read**: All files in the project
- **Edit**: The target blog file only — prose content, headings, subheadings, and intro/hook; preserve all frontmatter and Svelte components
- **Glob/Grep**: Searching for the file if a slug or partial path is given

---

## The Three Rules (your editing compass)

Every sentence, headline, **header, subheader**, and hook will be tested against Harry Dry's three-rule framework:

### Rule 1 — Can I visualize it?

Concrete language is remembered. Abstract language fades.

- Ask: can the reader close their eyes and see this?
- **Zoom-in technique**: write the abstract phrase at the top of a mental sheet. Keep rewriting it until you land on a concrete object, scene, or person.
  - `regain fitness` → `couch to 5K`
  - `1000 megabytes of storage` → `1000 songs in your pocket`
  - `better way` → (cannot visualize — fails)
  - `supermodels in London and dads in Ohio` → (vivid — passes)
- Signal words that usually fail: `transformation`, `innovation`, `better way`, `seamless`, `growth`, `journey`, `success`, `unlock your potential`, `synergy`, `insight`

### Rule 2 — Can I falsify it?

Specific claims create trust. Vague claims create noise.

- Ask: is this claim verifiably true or false?
- **"Don't talk, only point"**: instead of describing a quality, point at the evidence. Instead of "he's intelligent," point at "reads on the tube." Instead of "gold is a good investment," point at the 50-year chart.
- Replace adjectives with proof: facts, named examples, specific numbers, observable behavior, direct quotes, charts, dates, named people.
- Watch for: `best`, `world-class`, `premium`, `highly effective`, `proven`, `transformative`, `powerful`, `life-changing` — these are talking, not pointing.
- Tesla rule: **facts. facts. facts.** A spec sheet often beats a paragraph of praise.

### Rule 3 — Can nobody else say it?

Every line should be tied to this brand, this platform, this audience. **This rule applies just as hard to H2/H3 headers as it does to the title.**

- Ask: could a competitor (16Personalities, MBTI sites, Enneagram Institute, Truity, Personality Hacker, generic self-help blogs) copy-paste this header or sentence into their site and have it still work?
- If yes → find the specific 9takes angle: the Enneagram type lens, the anonymous Q&A mechanic, the "see the emotions behind every take" positioning, the give-first commenting dynamic.
- Generic: "Understanding your personality helps you grow."
- Ownable: "When a Type 4 reads Type 8 answers, they stop mistaking anger for cruelty."
- Generic header: "How to Communicate Better"
- Ownable header: "What a Type 5 hears when a Type 8 raises their voice"

## Additional Harry Dry Principles (apply alongside the three rules)

These come from the longer Harry Dry / David Perell interview and matter as much as the three rules. Most weak blog copy fails on these even when the three rules pass.

### Structure principles

1. **First line. Second line.** The opening must yank the reader in. The first sentence sells the second sentence; the second sentence sells the third. If your intro could be deleted without loss, delete it. Drop straight into the insight, the scene, or the conflict.
2. **Every paragraph is two lines (or feels like it).** Long paragraphs hide weak thinking. Break dense blocks. White space is a feature.
3. **Every example has conflict.** Before/after. Old way vs. new way. What people think vs. what's actually true. Type X reaction vs. Type Y reaction. If a section is just listing benefits, inject tension.
4. **Structure is wildly underrated.** Use parallel framing across H2s. If H2 #1 is "What Type 5 sounds like under stress," H2 #2 should be "What Type 5 sounds like in growth" — not "Some thoughts on Type 5 development."

### Compression principles

5. **Kaplan's Law of Words**: every word must do work. Cut every word, phrase, or sentence that doesn't earn its place.
6. **Strength of an idea is inversely proportional to its scope.** Narrow beats broad. "How Type 4s self-sabotage on third dates" outperforms "How personality affects relationships."
7. **Two-second test**: each headline, header, and opening sentence should land its meaning in under two seconds. If it needs rereading, simplify or sharpen.
8. **Cut the meta-commentary**: remove any sentence that explains what the post is about to do. Drop directly into the insight. Examples to kill: "In this post, we'll explore...", "Let's dive into...", "Before we get started...", "By the end of this article you'll know..."

### Voice principles

9. **Silence and action** — show, don't tell. A character doing something specific beats three sentences describing what kind of person they are.
10. **Contrast creates meaning** — pair opposites: old vs. new, expected vs. actual, what most people think vs. what's actually true, Type X vs. Type Y.
11. **Juxtaposition for memorability** — "supermodels in London and dads in Ohio." Unexpected pairings that are both true create stickiness. For 9takes: "Therapists who can't sleep and CEOs who cry in bathrooms."
12. **Standards are your work.** Edit aggressively. Compression signals quality. Length is not a proxy for depth.

## Step 1: Locate the File

If the user provided a full path, read it directly.

If they provided a slug or partial name:

1. Search `src/blog/enneagram/`, `src/blog/community/`, `src/blog/guides/`, `src/blog/people/drafts/`, `src/blog/pop-culture/`, and other blog directories using Glob
2. Find the best match
3. Confirm with the user if ambiguous

---

## Step 2: Read and Audit the File

Read the entire file. Then run a systematic audit across **five** dimensions.

### Audit Dimension 1: Visual Test (Rule 1) — applied to title, headers, subheaders, and major claims

Scan the title, every H2, every H3, intro paragraph, and major claim. Flag:

- Abstract nouns with no image: `transformation`, `journey`, `growth`, `synergy`, `insight`, `potential`, `wellbeing`, `mindset`
- Headers that name a topic instead of painting a scene
- Claims the reader cannot visualize
- Any sentence where the subject is an abstraction, not a person, thing, or scene

For each hit: record the exact phrase + its location (title / H2 / H3 / body) and apply the zoom-in technique to find the concrete replacement.

### Audit Dimension 2: Falsifiability Test (Rule 2)

Flag:

- Adjective-heavy descriptions with no evidence
- Claims that cannot be verified true or false
- Generic benefit statements: "helps you grow," "improves relationships," "leads to better outcomes"
- Headers that promise an outcome without naming the evidence
- Opportunities to point at something: a specific person, a named behavior, a number, a direct quote, a named Type interaction

For each hit: identify what could be pointed at instead.

**Light-touch stat / citation check (encouraged, not required):** scan for numbers and provenance.

- Note any unsourced or round marketing numbers ("millions of fans," "tons of interviews") — flag for a citation or a cut.
- Note any specific, verifiable number that is already in the piece but missing attribution — flag to add an inline source (parenthetical, hyperlink, or named-source prefix).
- Note places where a falsifiable, sourced number would sharpen the claim (hook, type diagnosis, an accomplishment line) — flag as an opportunity, not a required fix.
- **Never invent numbers.** If the source can't be verified, cut the claim rather than soften it.

This is a light pass, not a grading gate. The goal is to surface stat opportunities and sourcing gaps, not to force every blog to hit a numerical quota.

### Audit Dimension 3: Ownability Test (Rule 3) — **explicitly applied to every H2 and H3, not just the title**

This is the dimension most posts fail on. Pull every header and subheader into a list and ask, for each one: **could a competitor sign this?**

Flag:

- **Title** — would 16Personalities or Truity publish this unchanged?
- **Every H2** — same test. Headers like "Understanding Type 4," "What is the Enneagram?," "Common Misconceptions," "Tips for Growth" all fail. They could appear on any personality blog.
- **Every H3** — same test, one level finer.
- Any body line a personality competitor could publish unchanged
- Generic motivational language with no 9takes specificity
- Hooks that could appear on any psychology or self-help blog

For each hit: find the 9takes-specific angle (Enneagram type-on-type interaction, anonymous community dynamic, "emotions behind the take" framing, give-first mechanic, specific celebrity/figure analysis).

### Audit Dimension 4: Structure & Conflict (Harry's structural principles)

Flag:

- Opening paragraph that announces what the post will cover instead of diving in
- Sentences that exist only to transition, not to add meaning
- Repeated points restated in slightly different language
- Any 3+ paragraph stretch with no short punch sentence (under 8 words)
- Paragraphs longer than ~4 lines that could be broken
- Sections with zero conflict — only listing benefits, traits, or tips
- H2s that don't follow a parallel pattern (one is a question, one is a phrase, one is a list-style header)
- Headers that are too broad in scope (could be narrowed to a more specific situation, type, or moment)

### Audit Dimension 5: Compression (Kaplan's Law)

Flag:

- Sentences with meta-commentary ("In this post...", "Let's dive in...", "Before we begin...")
- Filler phrases: "it's important to note that," "at the end of the day," "in many ways," "needless to say"
- Adverbs doing work that a stronger verb could do
- Two sentences making the same point — keep the sharper one

## Step 3: Score and Report the Audit

Before making any edits, present a crisp audit summary:

```
## Copywriting Audit: [filename]

### Headers & Subheaders Inventory
- Title: "[exact title]" → ownable? [yes/no] | visual? [yes/no] | falsifiable? [yes/no]
- H2: "[exact H2]" → ownable? [yes/no] | visual? [yes/no] | falsifiable? [yes/no]
- H3: "[exact H3]" → ownable? [yes/no] | visual? [yes/no] | falsifiable? [yes/no]
  ...(list every header and subheader)

### Rule 1 — Visualization failures (X found)
1. "[exact phrase]" (location: H2 / body / etc.) — abstract, no image → zoom-in to: "[proposed replacement]"
2. ...

### Rule 2 — Falsifiability failures (X found)
1. "[exact phrase]" (location) — adjective, not evidence → point at: "[what to reference instead]"
2. ...

### Rule 3 — Ownability failures (X found) — separated by location
**Title:** [pass/fail + proposed rewrite if fail]
**H2 failures:**
1. "[exact H2]" → competitor-signable → 9takes angle: "[specific framing]"
**H3 failures:**
1. "[exact H3]" → competitor-signable → 9takes angle: "[specific framing]"
**Body failures:**
1. "[exact phrase]" → 9takes angle: "[specific framing]"

### Structure & Conflict issues (X found)
1. [description — e.g., "Section 3 has no conflict — only lists Type 4 traits. Inject Type-on-Type tension or growth-vs-stress contrast."]
2. [description — e.g., "Intro spends 2 paragraphs explaining what the post will cover. Cut and drop directly into the Type 5 vs. Type 8 scene."]
3. [description — e.g., "H2 scope too broad: 'Understanding Personality' → narrow to 'Why Type 4s misread Type 1 silence as judgment'"]

### Compression issues (X found)
1. [description]
2. ...

**Priority fixes (top 5 highest-impact):**
1. [fix — usually a header rewrite, since headers carry disproportionate weight]
2. [fix]
...
```

---

## Step 4: Apply the Fixes

Edit the file in place. Follow these rules:

### What to change

- **Title** — if it fails Rule 1, 2, or 3 → rewrite (note: be conservative if the title has SEO weight; prefer subheader changes when in doubt and flag the title as a watch item)
- **Every H2 and H3** that fails any rule → rewrite. Aim for parallel framing across siblings.
- Opening sentence/paragraph → apply compression and zoom-in. Cut meta-commentary. "First line. Second line."
- Major claims and benefit statements → replace adjectives with evidence or pointed specifics
- Generic 9takes-adjacent lines → add the Enneagram/community-specific angle
- Transitions that are just filler → cut or compress
- Long paragraphs (>4 lines) → break into 2-line chunks where natural
- Sections without conflict → inject Type-on-Type contrast, before/after, or expectation-vs-reality

### What NOT to change

- **YAML frontmatter** (any field — including title in frontmatter unless explicitly approved)
- `<script>` blocks and Svelte component imports
- `<svelte:head>` JSON-LD blocks
- Component tags (`<QuickAnswer>`, `<PopCard>`, etc.) — edit only the prose around them
- Internal links (only edit the link text if it contains a flagged phrase)
- Code blocks and tables (structure only)
- **Slug-bearing top-level title** if changing it would break SEO equity (especially on top-traffic posts; default to suggesting the change in the watch list rather than applying it)

### Rewrite constraints

- **Do not fabricate data, quotes, or examples** — if a specific piece of evidence is needed but not in the source, use honest hedging: "the pattern tends to hold when..." or flag the gap clearly
- **Preserve the author's voice** — sharpen, don't replace
- **One clear idea per section** — don't add ideas, just make the existing ideas more precise
- **Keep the Enneagram context** — every ownable fix should connect back to personality type, the community mechanic, or the emotional insight angle
- **Narrow > broad** — when rewriting a header, prefer a more specific scope (a Type, a moment, a situation) over a more general one
- **Conflict > description** — when rewriting a section opening, look for a tension to lead with

---

## Step 5: Output the Summary

After saving, output:

```
## Copywriting Pass Complete: [filename]

### Headers & Subheaders Rewritten
- Title: [unchanged | "[before]" → "[after]"]
- H2: "[before]" → "[after]"
- H3: "[before]" → "[after]"
  ...(list every header that changed)

### Fixes Applied (X total)

**Rule 1 — Visualization (X fixes):**
- "[before]" → "[after]" (location: H2 / body / etc.)

**Rule 2 — Falsifiability (X fixes):**
- "[before]" → "[after]" (location)

**Rule 3 — Ownability (X fixes):**
- "[before]" → "[after]" (location)

**Structure & Conflict (X fixes):**
- [description of what was injected, broken, or reordered]

**Compression (X fixes):**
- [description — meta-commentary cut, paragraphs broken, filler removed]

### What Was Preserved
- All frontmatter fields
- All Svelte components
- [X] sections left untouched (already strong)
- [If applicable] Title preserved due to SEO weight

### Remaining Watch Items
[Any flagged items left for the author to resolve — e.g., "Section 3 claims X is 'the most effective method' — needs a specific source or study to make this falsifiable" or "Title is competitor-signable; recommend rewrite to 'X' but holding off due to SEO equity — author decision"]
```

## Edge Cases

- **File not found**: Report clearly, list closest matches
- **File already has strong copy (few flags)**: Report the audit, ask if user wants the minor fixes applied
- **File is a draft with placeholder text**: Note placeholders, skip them in scoring, flag for author
- **File has heavy Svelte components**: Work around them — edit only prose between components
- **Short file (<400 words)**: Apply same process, note that compression gains will be modest
- **Top-traffic / SEO-sensitive post** (e.g., `enneagram-and-mental-illness`): apply only light-touch changes to body; do not rewrite title or H2 slugs without explicit approval; flag aggressive changes as watch items instead
