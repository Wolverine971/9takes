## Phase 1: Research & Intelligence Gathering (30 minutes)

### 1.1 Topic Research

### 1.2 Personality Pattern Analysis

### 2.2 Design Your Content Architecture

Pick the structure that best serves your topic:

**Structure A: The Problem-Solution Journey**

1. The expensive problem nobody talks about
2. Why conventional solutions fail
3. The neuroscience/psychology behind the issue
4. The 9 personality-based variations
5. The tactical toolkit
6. The 30-day transformation plan
7. Common objections destroyed
8. The meta-lesson

**Structure B: The Type-by-Type Deep Dive**

2. How Type 1s experience this (with fixes)
3. How Type 2s experience this (with fixes)
4. [Continue through all 9 types]
5. The integration framework
6. Your action plan

**Structure C: The Layered Framework**

1. The surface level (what everyone sees)
2. Layer 2 (what some people notice)
3. Layer 3 (what experts recognize)
4. Layer 4 (what masters understand)
5. How to progress through layers
6. The transformation timeline

### 2.3 Plan Your Conversion Points

- **Progress Milestones:** Create clear success metrics for each stage
- **Social Proof Points:** Plan where to add testing data or success stories

## Phase 3: Writing Execution (2-3 hours)

### 3.1 Writing Rules to Follow

**The Data-Driven Writing Principles:**

- **Be prescriptive, not descriptive:** Tell them exactly what to do
- **Use specific numbers when citing real sources:** Reference actual research, studies, or expert data
- **Create branded concepts:** "The 5-Second Rule", "The 4-Layer Framework"
- **Cite credible sources:** "According to [researcher/study]...", "Research from [institution] shows..."
- **Address objections directly:** "Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)"
- **Never fabricate data:** Only claim to have "tested" or "tracked" things you actually did

**The 9takes Integration:**

- **Make it personality-specific:** Each type gets targeted advice
- **Include type-specific examples:** "You check your phone while they're 'getting to the point'" (Type 3)
- **Reference the Enneagram naturally:** Not forced, but woven throughout
- **Link to related 9takes content:** Build the ecosystem

**The Engagement Tactics:**

- **Short paragraphs:** Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph
- **Bold key phrases:** Make it scannable
- **Use "you" and "your":** Direct address throughout
- **Include parenthetical asides:** (Revolutionary, right?)
- **Add personality:** "Shocking, we know" or "Yes, it'll feel weird"

### 3.2 Section Templates

**Opening Section Template:**

```
[Hook - Story, statistic, or paradox]

[The problem stated boldly]

[What this guide delivers - specific promise]

[Credibility statement - testing, research, or authority]

[Transition to first major section]
```

**Type Analysis Template:**

```
### Type [X]: The [Memorable Name]

**Your Brain's Background Process:** [What they're really doing]
**What You Miss:** [Their blind spot]

```
## The [Number]-[Concept] [Framework Name]

[Bold claim about why this matters]

[Quick story or example proving it works]

### [Level/Layer/Step] 1: [Memorable Name]
[What it is]
**What most people do:** [Common mistake]
**What you should do:** [Better approach]

### 3.3 Power Phrases to Sprinkle Throughout

**Credibility Builders (use only with actual sources):**

- "Enneagram theory suggests..."
- "A pattern that emerges across types is..."
- "In working with Enneagram concepts, I've observed..."
- "[Statistic from cited source] shows..."
