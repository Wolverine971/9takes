Needs to get back to its roots where it was more closely aligned with philosophy.

"Psychology at best is a soft science." Oh shit this guy has a brain, I'll watch the whole episode!

Marvin Williams
I don’t agree with that, it’s more irrational than soft. Logic is 1+1=2 but you cant make sense of jealousy and envy so rationally; it’s purely irrational. There’s clearly something to it else we wouldn’t have it

Keith
@Marvin Williams There are hard sciences and soft sciences. Psychology is a soft science. Full Stop. I agree with Chris that calling it a soft science at all is being generous.

Keith
@Marvin Williams Brother, google the definition of soft science.

Russell Scott
​ @Marvin Williams is sociology and philosophy soft sciences? They are now.

Marvin Williams
@Keith On the googled definition psychology is definitely a soft science.

However this negotiation guy didn't seem like that was what he was talking about. His later comments made it seem like psychology just had no basis or merit at all to even learn, particularly in negotiations, which seems like total bs

Marvin Williams
@Russell Scott I think so, I'd put economics in there as well, basically anything that is rooted in human nature. I just don't think science can control all the variables to give you predictable results. But that does not mean they aren't worthy pursuits to learn for real life, with all the variables that life entails

@Marvin Williams We don't have to agree on this, but that is where I am with him. I could see future discoveries about the human brain completely dismantling the entire field.

That is fricken right! The psychologists went down the wrong track a long time ago. They make their money treating disorders therefore they are a hammer and every person looks like a nail to them. Psychology needs to get back to normal people and create tools for them. It needs to closer align with philosophy. Check out 9takes I talk about this more there.
