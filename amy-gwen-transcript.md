00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
I think I'm an Enneagram one.

00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:03.061
Okay. Jackpot.

00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:04.901
Here we go. So, like,

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:07.981
I'm always trying to improve everything. Great.

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:11.701
So for people, and I don't know anyone who's heard of this who hasn't,

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:14.181
hopefully. What is Enneagram 1?

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.141
How would you describe. Are you into the Enneagram thing?

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:18.301
Very much. Again. Okay.

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:19.181
Do you want to guess my number?

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:20.681
Nobody ever gets it right.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.880
God,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.140
here we go. I'm always.

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.421
I always get the wrong. I always.

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:28.781
People guess the wrong number,

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.861
which saddens me cause I love.

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:33.021
Can I ask you. Yes.

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:34.901
Ask some questions, please.

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.101
Okay. Like,

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.841
how would you describe yourself

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.040
as someone who really enjoys a dinner party?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.640
Yes. Okay.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.320
Would you describe yourself

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.200
as somebody who is very focused on achieving? Yes.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.760
Are you a peacemaker? No.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.060
You're talking about three.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:04.941
You're talking about nine.

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:06.181
I'm neither one of those. I know.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:07.301
That's what I just cleaned.

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:08.101
Yeah.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.420
Um. So how.

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.621
I have a peacemaker wing. Okay.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:18.081
Ah, so you're a one.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400
You're not a one with a two wing?

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.680
No. Okay.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.060
You're not an 8. Yes,

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:28.081
you are. I. Okay.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.160
You're an 8. Why don't you know this?

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.900
You're an 8. You're an 8 with a 9 wing.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.421
Yes. So I'm not a monster, right?

00:01:35.422 --> 00:01:37.141
Cause I got a little peacemaker in me.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:38.421
Yeah, but I'm a.

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:39.341
I'm the. I'm a challenge.

00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:40.781
You're a challenge. Okay.

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:42.421
And I. And it's. I, I.

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:47.061
I think I hide it, but I definitely relate to all Of that feeling of,

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:48.661
like, hmm,

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:50.501
authority stuff, and challenging a little bit

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:52.101
and wanting to lead and want.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.581
And feeling very happy with direct people.

00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:55.381
Like, I'm.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.140
I'm like, you? Like,

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.461
I really like when people tell me the truth and are direct.

00:01:58.462 --> 00:01:59.481
I can handle it. Yeah.

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:00.821
All day long. Wow.

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:02.301
But when people come sideways,

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:03.541
I'm like, what's going on?

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:04.941
Yeah. It's such a bad,

00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:06.301
icky feeling. Bad feeling. Yeah.

00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:11.461
And I love Enneagram ones because ones are on it.

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:12.801
Yeah, we're on it.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.540
And they believe in, like,

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.741
getting it right. They're the hardest on themselves.

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:18.561
Oh, yeah.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.020
They are really hard on themselves.

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.081
Yeah. Um.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.740
But we are trying to make things better, right.

00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.861
We're the reformer. So you're always,

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:27.101
and I've always been, like,

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:31.701
refining to figure out what is a better way to get efficient.

00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:33.141
Like, to do it like. Yeah.

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:38.618
To improve yourself, to feel contentment, to, you know.
