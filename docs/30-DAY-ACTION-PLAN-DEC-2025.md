---

### Day 2: Thursday, December 5 — OPTIMIZE 3 PAGES

**Time Required: 5 hours**

#### Morning Block (3 hours): Optimize First High-Impact Page

**The Optimization Protocol (Apply to each page):**

**IMPORTANT: For celebrity/personality-analysis pages, use the DUAL-TITLE system:**

- `title` = Evergreen, authoritative (shown on page)
- `meta_title` = Clickbait, CTR-optimized (shown in search results)

The `PeopleBlogPageHead.svelte` component uses `meta_title` for SEO if it exists.

````
1. TITLE STRATEGY (Celebrity Pages Only)

   a. KEEP/REFINE the `title` (Evergreen - shown on page):
      ├── Current title: _______________
      ├── Is it professional and timeless? (Y/N)
      ├── If no, rewrite to: "[Person Name]: [Enneagram Type] Personality Analysis"
      └── Goal: Would this title be valuable 5 years from now?

   b. CREATE/UPDATE the `meta_title` (Clickbait - for search results):
      ├── What PROBLEM or CURIOSITY does this person represent? _______________
      ├── Patterns that work:
      │   ├── "Why [Person] Can't Stop [Behavior]"
      │   ├── "Inside [Person]'s Mind: [Insight]"
      │   ├── "The Real Reason [Person] [Did Thing]"
      │   └── "[Person]'s Hidden [Trait]: What It Reveals"
      └── New meta_title (max 60 chars): _______________

   Example:
   ├── title: "Elon Musk: An In-Depth Enneagram Type 5 Analysis"
   └── meta_title: "Inside Elon Musk's Mind: Why He Can't Stop Taking Risks"

2. META DESCRIPTION REWRITE
   ├── Current meta: _______________
   ├── Formula: Problem + Promise + Curiosity hook
   └── New meta (150-160 chars): _______________

3. ADD QUICK ANSWER BOX
   First, add the import to the script tag:
   ```svelte
   <script>
       import QuickAnswer from "$lib/components/blog/callouts/QuickAnswer.svelte";
   </script>
````

Then insert at very top of content:

```svelte
<QuickAnswer question="[The question your title implies]">
	[Direct 2-sentence answer to the implied question]
</QuickAnswer>
```

Note: The component includes Schema.org Answer markup for SEO.

4. REWRITE OPENING (first 150 words)
   Must include:
   ├── Name the problem directly
   ├── Validate reader's experience
   ├── Promise the solution
   └── Zero preamble/fluff

5. REMOVE HEDGING LANGUAGE
   Find and replace throughout:
   ├── "tend to" → "typically"
   ├── "might" → "often"
   ├── "can be" → "are"
   ├── "may experience" → "commonly experience"
   ├── "some people" → "many people"
   └── "it seems" → [delete or rewrite]

6. ADD/IMPROVE COMPARISON TABLE
   If applicable, create table comparing:
   ├── Types to each other
   ├── Healthy vs unhealthy behaviors
   └── Your framework vs competitors

7. UPDATE FAQ SECTION
   ├── Pull 3-5 actual queries from GSC
   ├── First sentence directly answers question
   └── Verify JSON-LD FAQPage schema correct

8. IMPROVE INTERNAL LINKING
   ├── Add 2-3 links TO this page from high-traffic pages
   └── Add 2-3 links FROM this page to related content

9. UPDATE TECHNICAL ELEMENTS
   ├── dateModified in frontmatter
   ├── JSON-LD dateModified
   └── Verify all schema is correct

```
