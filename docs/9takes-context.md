## 🎯 Core Mission & Values

**Tagline**: *"See the emotions behind every take"*

**Secondary**: *"One situation, 9 ways to see it"*

### 🎲 Core Problem We Solve

Social media has become inauthentic, filled with echo chambers and performative behavior. 9takes aims to restore serendipity, playfulness, and realness by creating structure for productive online conversations.

### 🧩 Unique Value Propositions

1. **Give-First Mechanic**: Comments are revealed after you comment, not before. This ensures original, unbiased responses
2. **Personality-Based Context**: Users are anonymous except for their Enneagram type, providing meaningful context without divisive demographics
3. **Question-Centric Design**: Questions invite responses and create meaningful interactions, unlike posts that don't encourage dialogue
4. **Open Source Conflict Resolution**: Transform personal dilemmas into crowd-sourced wisdom through diverse personality perspectives
