_Last Updated: 2025-12-03_

## Start Here

**Read first:** `/docs/START-HERE.md`

## The One Thing That Matters

**People search for PROBLEMS, not personality descriptions.**

GSC data proves mental health + problem-focused content wins. Type descriptions fail.

## Your Job: Execute, Don't Plan

### Priority 1: Create Problem-Focused Content

Write posts like:

- "Red Flags You're Dating Each Enneagram Type"
- "Why Your Enneagram Type Can't Stop [Problem]"
- "Enneagram and ADHD: Which Types Struggle Most"

### Priority 2: Optimize Existing Pages

For high-impression/low-click pages:

1. Rewrite title (problem-focused)
2. Add Quick Answer box
3. Remove hedging language

### Priority 3: AI Search Optimization

Add to top pages:

- Direct answer in first 2 sentences
- Comparison tables
- FAQ with real search queries

## Content Creation Framework

### Title Formula

❌ "The Complete Guide to Enneagram Wings"
✅ "Why You Don't Match Your Enneagram Description (It's Your Wing)"

### Opening Structure

```markdown
<div class="quick-answer">

**Quick Answer:** [Direct 2-sentence answer]

</div>

<p class="firstLetter">[Emotional hook naming the problem]</p>
```

### Post Structure

1. Quick Answer (for AI/snippets)
2. Hook (name the problem)
3. Why it happens (childhood → adult patterns)
4. What to do (actionable strategies)
5. Type-by-type application

## Do This / Don't Do This

### DO:

- Create mental health-angled content
- Write problem-focused titles
- Optimize existing high-impression pages
- Use shadow/toxic content angles
- Add Quick Answer boxes

### DON'T:

- Write more type descriptions
- Create new celebrity content (already 70%)
- Use hedging language ("tend to", "might")
- Plan more - strategy is complete
- Start new content before finishing drafts

---

## Decision Framework

When creating content, ask:

1. Does this solve a PROBLEM? (not describe a personality)
2. Is there a mental health angle?
3. Could this be titled as a question someone would search?
4. Does the title make someone curious/concerned?
