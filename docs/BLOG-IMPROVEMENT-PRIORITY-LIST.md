## Priority 3: Thin Content Needing Rewrite

These posts have weak content that doesn't meet the 9takes quality standards.

| Priority | Post                              | Grade | Issues                                              | Fix Time     | Status  |

| 3.2      | Community posts (8 total)         | C-D   | Most are opinion pieces, not actionable             | 1-2 hrs each |         |

### 3.1 enneagram-communication-tips.md - ✅ COMPLETED 2025-12-04

**Transformation Summary:**

| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title             | Generic | "What to Say to Each Enneagram Type (Scripts That Actually Work)" |
| Hook              | Weak    | "I said exactly what I meant. Why did they get so upset?"         |
| Word count        | ~1,200  | ~3,400                                                            |
| Tables            | 0       | 3 (filter table, quick ref, scenarios)                            |
| Scripts           | 0       | 27 (3 per type)                                                   |
| Childhood mapping | None    | All 9 types                                                       |
| Quick Answer      | Missing | Added                                                             |
| Internal links    | 0       | 15+ (styles, stress, relationships, toxic traits, all type pages) |
| Grade             | D       | A                                                                 |

**Differentiation achieved:** `communication-styles.md` = understanding WHY each type communicates differently. `communication-tips.md` = tactical scripts for WHAT to say in specific scenarios.
