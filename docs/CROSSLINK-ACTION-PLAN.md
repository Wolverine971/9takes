## Workflow for Fixing Posts

### Adding Outgoing Links

1. Open the post
2. Identify 3-5 related topics mentioned in the content
3. Add contextual links where topics are discussed
4. Prefer linking to hub posts and orphaned posts

### Getting Incoming Links (for orphaned posts)

1. Identify the 2-3 most relevant hub posts
2. Find a natural place to mention the orphaned content
3. Add a contextual link (not just a "see also" dump)

### Link Format

```markdown
