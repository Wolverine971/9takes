---

## 🎯 THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER

**People search for PROBLEMS, not personality descriptions.**

Your GSC data proves it:

- Mental health content: **177 clicks, 6.7% CTR** (TOP PERFORMER)
- Toxic traits content: **63 clicks, 4.8% CTR**
- Individual type posts: **0-5 clicks each** (despite quality)

### The 9takes Philosophy: "Clickbait to the Door, Quality Inside"

| Layer        | Purpose         | Style                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meta_title` | Get the click   | Clickbait, problem-focused, curiosity-inducing                 |
| `title`      | Build authority | Evergreen, professional, timeless                              |
| Content      | Create value    | Deep research, comprehensive analysis, stands the test of time |

**Why this works:** Viral titles drive traffic → Quality content earns trust → Deep analysis builds authority → Authority drives sustainable growth

## STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS (Audience-Aware Content)

**What this section is:** These frameworks help you create content that matches where your reader is in their journey. Even great advice falls flat if delivered to the wrong audience at the wrong time.

**Where these come from:** Adapted from the Viral Coach Masterclass, a professional content coaching course focused on social media growth.

> **Deep dive:** [`/docs/marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](./marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md) — Full course notes with detailed explanations of each framework.

### 1. Content Funnel (ToF/MoF/BoF)

Every piece of content serves one of three purposes:

| Stage                | Purpose             | % of Content | Example                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Top of Funnel**    | Attract new readers | 50%          | "Why dating apps are harder for certain types" |
| **Middle of Funnel** | Build trust         | 35%          | "How each type self-sabotages success"         |
| **Bottom of Funnel** | Convert             | 15%          | Direct CTAs, newsletter signups                |

**9takes gap:** Most content is Middle/Bottom. Need more Top of Funnel for growth.

### 2. Trust Onion Framework 🧅

New readers blame EXTERNAL factors. Meet them there before asking for self-reflection.

| Layer      | They Blame                          | Content Strategy                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Outer**  | Circumstances (time, apps, economy) | Validate struggles, offer quick wins      |
| **Middle** | Specific people (boss, ex, parents) | Pattern recognition, strategic advice     |
| **Inner**  | Themselves                          | Coaching content (only after trust built) |

**9takes gap:** Content often jumps to the Inner layer. Add more Outer layer content first.

### 3. EEO Continuum (Voice Calibration)

| Voice           | Use When          | Example                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Observation** | New/cold audience | "Studies show Type 5s tend to..."  |
| **Experience**  | Warming audience  | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| **Expert**      | Trusted audience  | "Type 5s do this because..."       |

**Default:** Start with Observation/Experience, earn the Expert voice.

### 4. Content Flywheel

Every blog post should generate 5-10 social posts:

```
Blog Post → X Thread → Standalone Tweets → Engagement → New Blog Ideas
    ↑__________________________________________________|
```

See [`/docs/writing-system/README.md`](./writing-system/README.md) for the full flywheel checklist.

## 🚫 STOP DOING

1. **Writing type descriptions** - They don't convert
2. **Academic/theoretical content** - No search volume
3. **New celebrity content** - Already 70% of site (overdeveloped)
4. **Hedging language** - Weakens authority for AI search
5. **Planning without executing** - Strategy is complete, execute it

---

## ✅ FOCUS ON

1. **Mental health angles** - Your proven traffic winner
2. **Problem-focused titles** - "Why you can't stop X" beats "What Type X is like"
3. **Shadow/toxic content** - People want to understand dark patterns
4. **Cross-system comparisons** - Astrology, MBTI, attachment styles work
5. **Optimizing existing pages** - Better ROI than new content

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Track Weekly

- [ ] GSC clicks on optimized pages (target: 2-3% CTR improvement)
- [ ] New content published (target: 2-3 problem-focused posts/week)

### 30-Day Targets

- [ ] 50% traffic increase on top 10 pages
- [ ] 5+ new problem-focused posts published

## 🎯 CONTENT CREATION QUICK REFERENCE

### Title Formula That Works

**For Enneagram/topical blogs:**
❌ "The Complete Guide to Enneagram Wings"
✅ "Why You Don't Match Your Enneagram Description (It's Your Wing)"

❌ "Understanding Type 4 Personality"
✅ "Type 4: Why You Feel Different From Everyone Else"

### Dual-Title System (Celebrity Blogs)

Celebrity blogs use TWO titles to balance virality with evergreen quality:

| Field        | Purpose       | Where It Shows                | Style                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `title`      | Page headline | On the blog page              | Evergreen, authoritative |
| `meta_title` | SEO/social    | Search results, social shares | Clickbait, CTR-optimized |

**How it works:** `PeopleBlogPageHead.svelte` uses `meta_title` for search/social if it exists.

**Examples:**

| Person       | `title` (Evergreen)                         | `meta_title` (Clickbait)                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elon Musk    | "Elon Musk: Enneagram Type 5 Analysis"      | "Inside Elon Musk's Mind: Why He Can't Stop Taking Risks" |
| Taylor Swift | "Taylor Swift: Type 3 Personality Analysis" | "Why Taylor Swift Can't Stop Reinventing Herself"         |
| IShowSpeed   | "IShowSpeed: Enneagram Type 7 Analysis"     | "Why IShowSpeed Acts So Crazy (It's Not What You Think)"  |

**Meta title patterns:**

- "Why [Person] Can't Stop [Behavior]"
- "Inside [Person]'s Mind: [Insight]"
- "The Real Reason [Person] [Did Thing]"
- "[Person]'s Hidden [Trait]: What It Reveals"

### Opening Formula

```svelte
<script>
	import QuickAnswer from '$lib/components/blog/callouts/QuickAnswer.svelte';
</script>

<QuickAnswer question="[The question your title implies]">
	[Direct answer to the implied question in 2 sentences]
</QuickAnswer>

<p class="firstLetter">[Emotional hook that names the problem]</p>
```

**Note:** The `QuickAnswer` component includes Schema.org Answer markup for SEO and has distinctive purple gradient styling.

### TypeQuotes Component (Enneagram Type Statements)

Use `TypeQuotes` to display characteristic quotes/statements from different Enneagram types. Perfect for showing how types express themselves or react differently to situations.

```svelte
<script>
	import TypeQuotes from '$lib/components/blog/callouts/TypeQuotes.svelte';
</script>

<TypeQuotes
	quotes={[
		{ type: 8, quote: "I'm not angry, I'm just passionate." },
		{ type: 9, quote: 'I never get angry.', note: "Narrator: They're seething inside" },
		{ type: 1, quote: "I'm not angry, I'm just frustrated things aren't done correctly." }
	]}
/>
```

**Props:**

- `quotes` (required): Array with `type` (1-9), `quote`, and optional `note`
- `title` (optional): Heading for the quote group
- `variant`: `'default'` (purple), `'subtle'` (gray), or `'minimal'` (no background)

**Features:** Color-coded badges per type, hover animations, dark mode support.

**Important:** Do NOT use `PopCard` for text quotes. `PopCard` is for image cards with overlays only.

### Content Structure

1. **Quick Answer** - Direct answer for AI/featured snippets
2. **Hook** - Name the problem emotionally
3. **Why it happens** - Psychological depth (childhood → adult patterns)
4. **What to do** - Specific, actionable strategies
5. **Type-by-type** - Practical application for each type

## 💡 THE PATH TO ENNEAGRAM DOMINANCE

**Your competitive advantages:**

1. Largest celebrity personality database online (215+ analyses)
2. Most comprehensive mental health + Enneagram integration
3. Problem-focused content (not just descriptions)
4. Real user data from Q&A platform

**The strategy is simple:**

1. Double down on mental health angles (proven winner)

3. Optimize existing high-impression pages (quick wins)
4. Let celebrity content drive discovery → practical content converts

**You're not competing on descriptions. You're competing on solutions.**
