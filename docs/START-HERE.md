# 9takes Content Strategy - START HERE

_Last Updated: 2025-12-03_
_Status: **PROBLEM-FOCUSED CONTENT PIVOT** - Mental health angle is your traffic goldmine_

---

## 🎯 THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER

**People search for PROBLEMS, not personality descriptions.**

Your GSC data proves it:

- Mental health content: **177 clicks, 6.7% CTR** (TOP PERFORMER)
- Toxic traits content: **63 clicks, 4.8% CTR**
- Individual type posts: **0-5 clicks each** (despite quality)

### The 9takes Philosophy: "Clickbait to the Door, Quality Inside"

| Layer        | Purpose         | Style                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meta_title` | Get the click   | Clickbait, problem-focused, curiosity-inducing                 |
| `title`      | Build authority | Evergreen, professional, timeless                              |
| Content      | Create value    | Deep research, comprehensive analysis, stands the test of time |

**Why this works:** Viral titles drive traffic → Quality content earns trust → Deep analysis builds authority → Authority drives sustainable growth

## 🚫 STOP DOING

1. **Writing type descriptions** - They don't convert
2. **Academic/theoretical content** - No search volume
3. **New celebrity content** - Already 70% of site (overdeveloped)
4. **Hedging language** - Weakens authority for AI search
5. **Planning without executing** - Strategy is complete, execute it

---

## ✅ FOCUS ON

1. **Mental health angles** - Your proven traffic winner
2. **Problem-focused titles** - "Why you can't stop X" beats "What Type X is like"
3. **Shadow/toxic content** - People want to understand dark patterns
4. **Cross-system comparisons** - Astrology, MBTI, attachment styles work
5. **Optimizing existing pages** - Better ROI than new content

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Track Weekly

- [ ] GSC clicks on optimized pages (target: 2-3% CTR improvement)
- [ ] New content published (target: 2-3 problem-focused posts/week)
- [ ] AI citations (check ChatGPT/Perplexity for mentions)

### 30-Day Targets

## 🎯 CONTENT CREATION QUICK REFERENCE

### Title Formula That Works

**For Enneagram/topical blogs:**
❌ "The Complete Guide to Enneagram Wings"
✅ "Why You Don't Match Your Enneagram Description (It's Your Wing)"

❌ "Understanding Type 4 Personality"
✅ "Type 4: Why You Feel Different From Everyone Else"

### Dual-Title System (Celebrity Blogs)

Celebrity blogs use TWO titles to balance virality with evergreen quality:

| Field        | Purpose       | Where It Shows                | Style                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `title`      | Page headline | On the blog page              | Evergreen, authoritative |
| `meta_title` | SEO/social    | Search results, social shares | Clickbait, CTR-optimized |

**How it works:** `PeopleBlogPageHead.svelte` uses `meta_title` for search/social if it exists.

**Examples:**

| Person       | `title` (Evergreen)                         | `meta_title` (Clickbait)                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elon Musk    | "Elon Musk: Enneagram Type 5 Analysis"      | "Inside Elon Musk's Mind: Why He Can't Stop Taking Risks" |
| Taylor Swift | "Taylor Swift: Type 3 Personality Analysis" | "Why Taylor Swift Can't Stop Reinventing Herself"         |
| IShowSpeed   | "IShowSpeed: Enneagram Type 7 Analysis"     | "Why IShowSpeed Acts So Crazy (It's Not What You Think)"  |

**Meta title patterns:**

- "Why [Person] Can't Stop [Behavior]"
- "Inside [Person]'s Mind: [Insight]"
- "The Real Reason [Person] [Did Thing]"
- "[Person]'s Hidden [Trait]: What It Reveals"

### Opening Formula

```markdown
<div class="quick-answer">

**Quick Answer:** [Direct answer to the implied question in 2 sentences]

</div>

<p class="firstLetter">[Emotional hook that names the problem]</p>
```

### Content Structure

1. **Quick Answer** - Direct answer for AI/featured snippets
2. **Hook** - Name the problem emotionally
3. **Why it happens** - Psychological depth (childhood → adult patterns)
4. **What to do** - Specific, actionable strategies
5. **Type-by-type** - Practical application for each type

## 💡 THE PATH TO ENNEAGRAM DOMINANCE

**Your competitive advantages:**

1. Largest celebrity personality database online (215+ analyses)
2. Most comprehensive mental health + Enneagram integration
3. Problem-focused content (not just descriptions)

4. Let celebrity content drive discovery → practical content converts

**You're not competing on descriptions. You're competing on solutions.**
