_**IMPORTANT: Check /docs/daily-progress for yesterday's work summary**_

## 🎯 Current Mission

Transform 9takes into THE definitive authority for personality-based life optimization through strategic content creation, filling critical gaps, and building domain authority in 6 key areas.

## 📋 REASSESSMENT SUMMARY (Sept 14, 2025)

### What's Working Well

- **Content Production:** Steady creation of high-quality guides
- **Admin Tools:** New diff viewer and content board improving workflow
- **Core Enneagram Content:** Strong foundation with 70+ posts (20%)
- **Mental Health Suite:** Comprehensive coverage with 12 guides

### Key Challenges

- **Content Imbalance:** Still 69% celebrity content vs <5% practical guides

- **Optimization Gap:** Only 2.6% - missing morning routines, habits, goal setting
- **Social Media Execution:** Content ready but not being posted consistently
