# 9takes Content Strategy - START HERE

_Last Modified: 2025-12-03 - TRAFFIC DATA ANALYSIS COMPLETE, IMAGES VERIFIED_
_Status: **CRITICAL PIVOT NEEDED** - Mental Health Content Dominating, Type Posts Failing_
_**NEW PRIORITY: Fix high-impression/zero-click pages + AI search optimization**_

## 🚨 URGENT: Traffic Reality Check (Google Search Console Data)

### What's ACTUALLY Working:

1. **Mental health content** - 147 clicks (enneagram-and-mental-illness) - TOP PERFORMER
2. **"Toxic traits" content** - 42 clicks - People want shadow content
3. **Cross-system comparisons** - 31 clicks (astrology-and-enneagram)
4. **Practical/actionable guides** - 21 clicks (biggest-compliments)

### What's FAILING (Despite Quality):

- **Individual Type Posts (1-9)**: 0-5 clicks each (massive fail)
- **Wings Guide**: 628 impressions, 0 clicks (title problem!)
- **Anxiety Guide**: 471 impressions, 0 clicks
- **Many relationship posts**: 0 clicks despite impressions

### KEY INSIGHT: People search for PROBLEMS, not personality descriptions

## 🎯 NEW Mission (Based on Data)

Transform 9takes into THE authority for personality-based PROBLEM SOLVING (not descriptions) through AI-optimized, problem-focused content that actually gets clicked.

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Updated Dec 3, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Zero-Click Pages Optimized

All 5 high-impression/zero-click pages have been optimized with clickbait titles, Quick Answer boxes, and comparison tables:

| Page                               | Original Issue              | New Title                                                                      | Status             |

### ✅ COMPLETED: AI Search Optimization

- [x] Add "Quick Answer" box to top 5 pages
- [x] Remove hedging language (minimal found - already clean)
- [x] Update FAQs with actual search queries (JSON-LD FAQPages in place)
- [x] Add comparison tables to mental health content (anxiety guide updated)
- [ ] Include "When to Seek Help" sections (mental health guides have crisis resources)

### 🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES: Create Problem-Focused Content
