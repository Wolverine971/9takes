# 9takes Content Strategy - START HERE

_Last Modified: 2025-10-23 - TRAFFIC DATA ANALYSIS COMPLETE_
_Status: **CRITICAL PIVOT NEEDED** - Mental Health Content Dominating, Type Posts Failing_
_**NEW PRIORITY: Fix high-impression/zero-click pages + AI search optimization**_

## 🚨 URGENT: Traffic Reality Check (Google Search Console Data)

### What's ACTUALLY Working:

1. **Mental health content** - 147 clicks (enneagram-and-mental-illness) - TOP PERFORMER
2. **"Toxic traits" content** - 42 clicks - People want shadow content
3. **Cross-system comparisons** - 31 clicks (astrology-and-enneagram)
4. **Practical/actionable guides** - 21 clicks (biggest-compliments)

### What's FAILING (Despite Quality):

- **Individual Type Posts (1-9)**: 0-5 clicks each (massive fail)
- **Wings Guide**: 628 impressions, 0 clicks (title problem!)
- **Anxiety Guide**: 471 impressions, 0 clicks
- **Many relationship posts**: 0 clicks despite impressions

### KEY INSIGHT: People search for PROBLEMS, not personality descriptions

## 🎯 NEW Mission (Based on Data)

Transform 9takes into THE authority for personality-based PROBLEM SOLVING (not descriptions) through AI-optimized, problem-focused content that actually gets clicked.

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Based on Traffic Data - Oct 23, 2025)

### TODAY'S CRITICAL FIXES (Do These First!)

#### 1. Fix Zero-Click Pages (High Impressions, No Clicks)

These pages are being shown by Google but not clicked - FIX TITLES/METAS NOW:

| Page                               | Impressions | Clicks | Action                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enneagram-wings-complete-guide     | 628         | 0      | Change title to: "Am I 4w3 or 4w5? Find Your Enneagram Wing" |
| enneagram-anxiety-complete-guide   | 471         | 0      | Change to: "Why Type 6 Isn't the Only Anxious Type (Guide)"  |
| enneagram-type-4                   | 394         | 0      | Change to: "Type 4: Why You Feel Different From Everyone"    |
| enneagram-strengths-and-weaknesses | 1,002       | 8      | Add urgency: "Your Type's Fatal Flaw (And Hidden Strength)"  |
| enneagram-types-in-stress          | 912         | 2      | Change to: "How Each Type Falls Apart Under Stress"          |

#### 2. Optimize Top Performers for AI Search

Add these elements to your best pages TODAY:

- **Quick Answer boxes** at the very top
- **Remove hedging language** ("tend to" → "commonly")
- **Add structured FAQs** with real search queries
- **Include comparison tables**

#### 3. Create Problem-Focused Content (This Week)

- "Red Flags You're Dating Each Enneagram Type"
- "Why Your Enneagram Type Can't Stop [Problem]"
- "Enneagram and ADHD: Which Types Struggle Most"

### AI Search Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Add "Quick Answer" box to top 5 pages
