## Key Learnings

### What Worked Best

1. **Batch content creation** — Writing all 5 posts in rapid succession (Dec 3-7) created momentum
2. **Dual-title system** — meta_title for CTR, title for authority works well
3. **Problem-focused framing** — Shadow content (manipulation, toxic traits, red flags) resonates
4. **Template systems** — Having checklists reduced friction significantly

### What Was Challenging

1. **GSC lag** — Changes take 2-4 weeks to show in data
2. **FAQ/table targets** — Fell short of 10/8 targets (hit 6+/4+)
3. **Week 4 analysis** — Holiday timing complicated measurement

### Surprising Discoveries

1. Mental health + shadow content consistently outperforms descriptive content
2. Celebrity pages have massive impression potential (22K+ for IShowSpeed)
3. Internal linking from power pages drives measurable traffic to new content
