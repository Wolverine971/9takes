```
Each type page should link to:
- Wings guide section for their type
- Compatibility matrix (their row)
- Dating guide relevant to them
- Career choices mentioning their type
- Shadow work section for their type
- Stress patterns section
```

#### 2. Hub Page Links (create navigation hubs)

```
Enneagram Core Hub:
├── All 9 type profiles
├── Wings guide
├── Subtypes guide
├── Stress/Growth patterns
└── FAQs & Basics

Relationships Hub:
├── Compatibility matrix
├── Dating guides (men/women)
├── Communication guides
├── Conflict resolution
└── Red flags & toxic traits

Self-Development Hub:
├── Personality maxing
├── 90-day blueprint
├── Shadow work
├── Strengths/weaknesses
└── Self-sabotage patterns
```

#### 3. Contextual Cross-Links (within content)

```
When discussing... → Link to...
─────────────────────────────────
Stress patterns → Mental health flags
Dating behavior → First impressions
Team conflicts → Communication guides
Self-improvement → 90-day blueprint
Type descriptions → Celebrity examples
Relationship issues → Compatibility matrix
