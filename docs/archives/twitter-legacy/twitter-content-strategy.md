## Executive Summary

This document outlines a 30-day Twitter content strategy to promote recently updated Enneagram blogs, build authority in the personality psychology space, and drive traffic to the 9takes platform.

---

## Current Best Practices (2025)

### Optimal Posting Times

- **Peak engagement windows:**
  - Weekdays: 8-10 AM EST (morning commute)
  - Weekdays: 12-1 PM EST (lunch break)
  - Weekdays: 5-6 PM EST (evening wind-down)
  - Sundays: 9-11 AM EST (Sunday scroll)

### Thread Best Practices

- **Hook within first 7 words** (before "show more")
- **3-7 tweets optimal** (not too short, not overwhelming)
- **Visual breaks** with emojis/line breaks
- **Number each tweet** (1/5, 2/5, etc.)
- **CTA in final tweet** always
- **Reply with additional value** after thread posts

### Engagement Tactics

- Post thread → Wait 1 hour → Add valuable reply
- Quote tweet your own thread next day with different angle
- Create "bookmark bait" (high-value content people save)
- Use polls to boost engagement before thread drops

## Thread Templates & Content

### WEEK 1: DECODE PEOPLE INSTANTLY

#### Thread 1: The Body Language Cheat Sheet

**Post Date**: Monday, Week 1 @ 9 AM EST
**Target Audience**: Business professionals, networkers, people pleasers
**Hook**: "I read 100+ people wrong until I learned these 9 body language patterns"
**Structure**: Problem → Discovery → 3 examples → Revelation → CTA
**CTA**: "Want the complete guide? I broke down all 9 types here: [link]"

```
1/5 I read 100+ people wrong until I learned these 9 body language patterns.

Now I know within 30 seconds what someone needs from me.

Here's the cheat code that changed everything:

2/5 The revelation:
People aren't mysterious. They're predictable.

Everyone scans for ONE thing:
• Type 1s: Competence
• Type 3s: Success
• Type 8s: Strength

Give them what they're scanning for → instant connection

3/5 Example that blew my mind:

That "cold" person who won't make eye contact?
They're not rude (Type 5).
They're conserving emotional energy.

Lead with ideas, not feelings → watch them light up

4/5 The "aggressive" person who dominates conversation?
They're not trying to intimidate (Type 8).
They're testing if you're strong enough to trust.

Stand your ground respectfully → earn instant respect

5/5 Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them.

First impressions become predictable.
Networking becomes strategic.
Relationships finally make sense.

#### Thread 2: Job Interview Mind Reading

**Post Date**: Wednesday, Week 1 @ 12 PM EST
**Target Audience**: Job seekers, career changers, young professionals
**Hook**: "Failed 5 interviews until I realized: I was using the wrong personality playbook"
**Structure**: Failure story → Realization → Framework → Success → CTA
**CTA**: "Master any interview by reading your interviewer: [link]"

```
1/4 Failed 5 interviews until I realized:
I was using the wrong personality playbook.

The perfectionist boss needs different signals than the visionary CEO.

Here's what changed everything:

2/4 The framework:
• Checking their watch constantly? Show competence (Type 1)
• Talking about company mission? Show passion (Type 2/3)
• Testing you with tough questions? Show strength (Type 8)

Match their energy → speak their language

3/4 Real example:
Interview with detail-obsessed director.
Instead of selling myself, I said:
"I noticed your process has 3 inefficiencies. Here's how I'd fix them."

Hired on the spot.

4/4 Stop using generic interview advice.
Start reading the person across from you.

Their body language tells you EXACTLY what they want to hear.

#### Thread 3: First Date Psychology

**Post Date**: Friday, Week 1 @ 5 PM EST
**Target Audience**: Singles, dating app users, relationship seekers
**Hook**: "She ghosted me after 3 perfect dates. Then I learned why..."
**Structure**: Personal story → Pattern recognition → Insight → Application → CTA
**CTA**: "Never misread a date again: [link]"

```
1/6 She ghosted me after 3 "perfect" dates.

Then I learned why:
I was speaking the wrong emotional language.

Here's what I wish I knew earlier:

2/6 The pattern I missed:
• Unique style ✓
• Deep conversations ✓
• Intensity ✓

She was Type 4 (The Individualist)
I was treating her like Type 7 (keeping it light)

3/6 Type 4s need depth, not fun.
They want to be seen as unique, not entertained.

I was doing standup comedy.
She wanted soul connection.

4/6 The lesson:
Some people want laughter (Type 7)
Some want success stories (Type 3)
Some want vulnerability (Type 4)

Read them wrong → instant disconnect

5/6 Now I know in 30 seconds:
• Their body language
• What they're scanning for
• How to connect authentically

Dating became 10x easier

6/6 Stop guessing what people want.
Learn to read their personality type.

Your dating life will never be the same: [link]

### WEEK 2: YOUR HIDDEN PATTERNS

#### Thread 4: Relationship Self-Sabotage

**Post Date**: Monday, Week 2 @ 9 AM EST
**Target Audience**: People in relationships, self-improvement focused
**Hook**: "I killed every relationship the same way for 10 years"
**Structure**: Pattern admission → Root cause → Types overview → Solution → CTA
**CTA**: "Find your sabotage pattern: [link]"

```
1/5 I killed every relationship the same way for 10 years.

Three months in, like clockwork:
The self-destruct sequence.

Here's the pattern I couldn't see:

2/5 My Type 5 pattern:
Month 1: Fascinated
Month 2: Analyzing
Month 3: Withdrawing

I thought I was "needing space"
I was actually terrified of being consumed

3/5 Everyone has a pattern:
• Type 1: Death by criticism
• Type 2: Death by people-pleasing
• Type 3: Death by performance
• Type 7: Death by FOMO

You can't fix what you can't see

4/5 The breakthrough:
Once I saw my pattern, I could interrupt it.

Now when I want to withdraw, I share one feeling instead.
Small shift. Massive difference.

5/5 Your relationship failures aren't random.
They're predictable.

Find your pattern, break your pattern: [link]
```

#### Thread 5: Why You're Actually Single

**Post Date**: Wednesday, Week 2 @ 8 AM EST
**Target Audience**: Singles, dating app users
**Hook**: "You're not single because of bad luck"
**Structure**: Myth bust → Truth bomb → Examples → Insight → CTA
**CTA**: "Discover what's really blocking you: [link]"

```
1/4 You're not single because of:
• Bad luck
• "All the good ones are taken"
• Your looks

You're single because of an unconscious pattern you've been running since childhood.

2/4 The pattern:
Type 8: "I must never be vulnerable" → No one can reach you
Type 9: "I must keep the peace" → You disappear
Type 4: "I need extraordinary love" → You reject ordinary connection

3/4 Mine (Type 5):
"If I open up, I'll be consumed"

So I dated at arm's length.
Analyzed instead of felt.
Wondered why no one stayed.

4/4 The pattern runs your life whether you see it or not.

See it → change it → connect differently

### WEEK 3: DATING DECODED

#### Thread 6: Why You Got Ghosted

**Post Date**: Monday, Week 3 @ 12 PM EST
**Target Audience**: Recently ghosted, dating app users
**Hook**: "Getting ghosted isn't about you. It's about your type."
**Structure**: Reframe → Type patterns → Healing approach → CTA
**CTA**: "Heal based on your type: [link]"

```
1/5 Getting ghosted isn't about you.
It's about your type.

Each personality type has a specific ghosting wound:

2/5 Type 1: "I wasn't perfect enough"
Type 2: "I didn't give enough"
Type 3: "I wasn't impressive enough"
Type 4: "I'm too much"
Type 8: "I was too intense"

Same experience. Different wound.

3/5 The Type 2 spiral:
"Maybe they didn't see my text"
"Are they hurt?"
"I'll just check in once more..."

Creating excuses for them.
Blaming yourself.

4/5 The healing (Type 2):
Your value exists independently of what you do for others.

Their inability to appreciate you doesn't diminish your worth.

5/5 Ghosting hurts everyone.
But it hurts differently based on your type.

Heal the right wound: [link]
```

#### Thread 7: Dating Guide for Men

**Post Date**: Thursday, Week 3 @ 5 PM EST
**Target Audience**: Single men, dating apps users
**Hook**: "Nice guys don't finish last. They're using the wrong playbook."
**Structure**: Myth bust → Truth → Type examples → Solution → CTA
**CTA**: "Get your type-specific dating guide: [link]"

```
1/4 Nice guys don't finish last.
They're using the wrong playbook.

Type 9 "nice guys" disappear into agreement.
Type 2 "nice guys" give until they're empty.

It's not about being nice. It's about being real.

2/4 The problem by type:
Type 1: Too critical
Type 3: Too performed
Type 5: Too distant
Type 9: Too agreeable

Women don't want perfect. They want authentic.

3/4 Example (Type 3):
Stop: LinkedIn dating profile
Start: Sharing an actual failure

She doesn't need your resume.
She needs your humanity.

4/4 Every type has a dating superpower.
And a fatal flaw.

Know yours → use yours → find real connection: [link]
```

### WEEK 4: THE TRUTH ABOUT PERSONALITY

#### Thread 8: Is the Enneagram Real?

**Post Date**: Monday, Week 4 @ 9 AM EST
**Target Audience**: Skeptics, curious professionals
**Hook**: "The Enneagram isn't scientifically proven. Here's why I use it anyway."
**Structure**: Acknowledge doubt → Counter → Evidence → Nuance → CTA
**CTA**: "Get all your questions answered: [link]"

```
1/6 The Enneagram isn't scientifically proven.

Neither was meditation 20 years ago.

Here's why I still use it:

2/6 It works.

Google uses it.
Thousands of therapists use it.
I've seen it save marriages.

Not because it's "scientific"
Because it reveals patterns.

3/6 The real test:
Read about your type.

If it makes you uncomfortable because it's TOO accurate about your flaws...

That's not pseudoscience.
That's pattern recognition.

4/6 It's not about predicting the future.
It's about understanding the present.

Why you sabotage.
Why you withdraw.
Why you perform.

5/6 Use it as a lens, not a label.
A tool, not truth.

Hold it lightly.
But hold it.

6/6 Skeptical? Good.
Come with questions.

I answer the 27 everyone asks: [link]
```

#### Thread 9: Your Type Can't Change (Here's Why That's Good)

**Post Date**: Wednesday, Week 4 @ 12 PM EST
**Target Audience**: Personal development community
**Hook**: "Your Enneagram type never changes. That's the best news you'll hear today."
**Structure**: Counter-intuitive → Explanation → Analogy → Hope → CTA
**CTA**: "Learn your growth path: [link]"

```
1/5 Your Enneagram type never changes.

That's the best news you'll hear today.

Here's why:

2/5 If your type could change, you'd never know what to work on.

But because Type 2s always struggle with boundaries...
And Type 8s always struggle with vulnerability...

The path is clear.

3/5 Think of it like handedness:
Born right-handed? That's fixed.

But you can:
• Strengthen your left
• Become ambidextrous
• Master fine motor skills

Same with personality.

4/5 Your core type = your curriculum
Your growth path = your degree

Everyone has different homework.
But the assignment is clear.

5/5 Stop trying to change your type.
Start mastering it.

Your personalized growth path: [link]
