## 1. Brand Essence

| Pillar                              | One‑liner                                                               | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seeing through different lenses** | _“One situation, 9 ways to see it.”_                                    | People attend to different details; surfacing them expands collective intelligence.                                                                            |
| **Get out of your bubble**          | _“Give your take, then see everyone else’s.”_                           | The give‑first mechanic prevents echo‑chamber bias and fuels honest reflection.                                                                                |
| **Metabolic Perspective Workout**   | _“Digesting new views burns mental glucose—& builds cognitive muscle.”_ | Frames perspective‑taking as challenging but gainful, like a gym session for the brain.                                                                        |
| **Personality‑Maxing**              | _“Know your strengths and weaknesses. Level‑up, get healthy.”_          | Self‑knowledge + targeted drills turn blind spots into competitive advantages.                                                                                 |
| **Ancient Wisdom**                  | "Both Plato and Freud alluded to the enneagram"                         | Plato discussed 3 parts of the soul, Freud talked about 3 parts of the psyche. The enneagram brings these together with the 3 core emotions and intelligences. |

- **Oxford comma**: Yes.
- **Numbers**: Use numerals (“9 lenses”).
- **Em dashes** for sharp asides; minimal parentheses.

1. Hook line (<120 chars, benefit or contrarian).
2. 2‑3 crisp points (one per line).
3. Action takeaway (emoji optional).

Example:

> Digesting new angles is metabolically _expensive_—but that’s where the IQ gains live. 😤  
> ① Run “emotional recon” ② Match vibe ③ Pull the right thread.  
> Gym for your brain → 9takes.com
