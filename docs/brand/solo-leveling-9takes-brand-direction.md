## What We're NOT Keeping from Solo Leveling

### Terminology to Avoid

- "Shadow Monarch" / "Shadow Army"
- "Arise"
- "Hunter" / "Dungeon" / "Gate"
- "S-Rank" / "E-Rank" rankings
- Any direct Solo Leveling story references

### Replace With 9takes Language

| Instead of...     | Use...                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "Shadow soldiers" | "Personality archetypes" or "types"  |
| "Arise"           | "Unlock" / "Develop" / "Max out"     |
| "Hunter ranking"  | "Awareness levels" / "Growth stages" |
| "Dungeon"         | "Challenge" / "Situation"            |
| "System"          | "Framework" / "Pattern recognition"  |

## The Bridge: Personality Maxing = Leveling Up

### Core Insight

Both Solo Leveling and personality maxing share a common appeal:

- **Solo Leveling**: Sung Jin-woo levels up through challenges, becoming stronger
- **Personality Maxing**: You level up through perspective-taking, becoming emotionally stronger

### The Mental Gym Concept

From your existing content:

> "Physical exercise builds physical strength. Perspective-taking builds mental strength."

This is the perfect bridge. Frame 9takes as:

- **The gym for your mind**
- **Reps** = perspective-taking exercises
- **Progressive overload** = increasingly challenging perspectives
- **Gains** = emotional intelligence, social calibration, self-awareness

### Existing 5-Phase Framework

1. **Define** - What is personality?
2. **Document** - Map your patterns
3. **Discover** - Find your type
4. **Dive Deep** - Strengths, weaknesses, triggers
5. **Deploy** - Apply to real situations

This could be gamified as "levels" or "phases" a user progresses through.

## Gamification Ideas (To Flesh Out)

### Personality Analysis Blogs - Gamified Stats

For famous person analyses, add:

```
PROFILE: [Celebrity Name]
TYPE: [1-9]
LEVEL: [Healthy/Average/Unhealthy expression]

STATS:
- Strengths: [List with visual bars]
- Weaknesses: [List with visual bars]
- Lore: [Key formative experiences]

ENNEAGRAM CENTERS:
- Emotional: [Heart triad expression]
- Intellectual: [Head triad expression]
- Instinctual: [Gut triad expression]

SIGNATURE MOVES: [Type-specific behaviors]
STRESS PATTERN: [Arrow of disintegration]
POWER MODE: [Arrow of integration]
```

### User Journey Gamification

- Track perspective-taking "reps"
- Unlock understanding of different types
- Progress through awareness levels
- Earn insights through engagement

---

## Questions to Flesh Out

### 1. Visual Direction

**Q1.1: How far should we lean into the "system UI" aesthetic?**

- Full immersive gaming interface (health bars, stat windows, notifications)
- Subtle system accents (glowing borders, clean data displays)
- Minimal (just the color scheme applied to current design)

Answer: I want you to fully lean into the system UI aesthetic. The subtle system accents are okay.

**Q1.2: Should each Enneagram type have its own visual "realm" or aesthetic variation?**

- Example: Type 4 content has more purple/violet hues, Type 8 has more red tones
- Or keep consistent aesthetic across all types?

Answer: I would like it if each Enneagram type has its own visual realm aesthetic, but not too much. It needs to be very on brand and very on point.

**Q1.3: How prominent should particle effects and animations be?**

- Heavy (constant ambient particles, animated backgrounds)
- Moderate (on hover, transitions, key moments)
- Subtle (minimal, mostly static)

Answer: I like the particle effect, but I don't want to overdo it and distract from the content.

### 2. Leveling Up / Personality Maxing Framework

**Q2.1: What does "leveling up" look like for a 9takes user?**

Options:
a) **Awareness Levels** - Beginner > Intermediate > Advanced understanding of Enneagram
b) **Type Mastery** - Progress in understanding each of the 9 types
c) **Perspective Reps** - Track number of different viewpoints engaged with
d) **Self-Knowledge Journey** - 5-phase framework as literal progression
e) **Something else?**

Answer: it means multiple things. Yes, awareness levels. They should have good situational awareness. They should understand the Enneagram nicely. They should have very good emotional awareness, and they should be aware of the triads. The triads being the emotional triad, the intellectual triad, and the instinctual triad. With the emotions they should learn about the three core emotions:

1. Shame
2. Fear
3. Anger
   These are all have to do with self-understanding and leveling up. They should be able to identify these emotions in themselves, and they should be able to identify these emotions in others. These are the root emotions. They should also just know about themselves deeply and be able to humbly speak about themselves. And I want you to also research more about what this means and different things you could tap into with regards to leveling up.

**Q2.2: Should leveling be visible/tracked or implicit?**

- Visible progression system (XP, levels, badges)
- Implicit growth (content unlocks, depth increases)
- No formal tracking (just the metaphor)

Answer: there should be no formal tracking, just the metaphor. But with that, we should point out things that most people get wrong about this type or what most people don't realize about this type or this person in particular. These kinds of callouts should indicate secret knowledge and hidden things that people overlook or counter-intuitive things.

**Q2.3: What's the "max level" or end state?**
Your existing content says:

> "Genuine curiosity about others is the destination of personality maxing"

Is this the ultimate achievement? Or are there other milestones?

Answer: this is just kind of like the default mindset that we want to foster. We want people to be genuinely curious about others. Yes, there are milestones.

1. You learn about yourself, and you learn about your strengths and weaknesses.
2. You learn to be vulnerable.
3. You start diving into other people's psychology and stuff like that, so that you can kind of build bridges and build mutual understanding.

### 3. Gamified Stats for Celebrity Analyses

**Q3.1: What stats should we display for famous people?**

Proposed:

- Core Type + Wing
- Health Level (1-9 scale from Enneagram)
- Instinctual Variant (SO/SP/SX)
- Tritype (if relevant)
- Key strengths (3-5)
- Key weaknesses/blind spots (3-5)
- Stress pattern
- Growth pattern

What else would add value?

Answer: I don't want to necessarily get into wings because that's a distraction. I don't think we should do health level either. I think we could talk about instinctual variants. I don't want to get into tri types. Strengths and weaknesses are good, stress pattern and growth pattern are good. The other thing is like Lore. What the history of this person is and what their background is. Also, key achievements is good. I think those are opportunities for us to flesh things out. In general, super powers. I'm going to flesh out what their super power is, as if it were a Pokemon card or something, where we talk about what this person's unique gift is.

**Q3.2: Should stats be visual (bars, charts, radar charts) or text-based?**

- Visual bars/meters (gaming aesthetic)
- Radar/spider charts (analytical feel)
- Text lists with icons
- Hybrid approach

Answer: I like the analytic feel, but I also like the hybrid approach. I don't have strong opinions on this. I don't want to overdo the tech, the gaming aesthetic.

**Q3.3: What "lore" elements should we include?**

- Formative childhood experiences
- Key life events that shaped them
- Relationships that reveal their type
- Career choices through type lens
- Public moments that show patterns

Answer: all these are good things to include.

**Q3.4: How deep should the emotional/intellectual/instinctual breakdown go?**

The three centers of intelligence:

- **Heart/Feeling Center** (Types 2, 3, 4) - Emotional processing
- **Head/Thinking Center** (Types 5, 6, 7) - Mental processing
- **Gut/Instinct Center** (Types 8, 9, 1) - Visceral processing

Options:
a) Brief mention of dominant center
b) Score/analysis for all three centers regardless of type
c) Deep dive into how they express each center
d) Compare to typical expression for their type

Answer: we should mention this and how this shows up in this person's life or speak to different things that they've been through and how they might have been thinking, feeling, or what they were doing. But I don't want to over-explain it in the personality analysis blogs. I want to strategically link to deeper analysis and deeper dives in the Enneagram blogs where we go into the Enneagram corner.

### 4. Platform Gamification

**Q4.1: Should 9takes have user profiles with stats/progression?**

- Yes, full gamified profiles
- Minimal (just type and basic info)
- No user profiles beyond account

Answer: it's going to be hard to track stats, but one thing I would want to build is like blogs and how much if they've read certain blogs or certain things. This would be a technical effort to build this part out, but that would be nice. Kind of flesh out what areas they've dove into and which areas they haven't dove into.

**Q4.2: What actions should be "rewarded" or tracked?**

- Questions asked
- Perspectives given (comments)
- Types explored (content read)
- Accuracy in typing (if we had a typing game)
- Community engagement

Answer: I like all these things except accuracy and typing. Let's not build a typing game.

**Q4.3: How competitive vs. personal should progression be?**

- Leaderboards, rankings (competitive)
- Personal journey only (no comparison)
- Community achievements (collaborative)

Answer: no, we don't. I'm not sure about this. I would like the contribution piece to be there. But I don't know if we should do leaderboards or rankings. These seem not helpful.

### 5. Content & Copy Direction

**Q5.1: What's the tone for "leveling up" language?**

- Hype/motivational ("UNLOCK YOUR FULL POTENTIAL")
- Clinical/analytical ("Develop your emotional intelligence systematically")
- Casual/conversational ("Get better at reading people")
- Blend of above?

Answer: I like a mix of the clinical and analytical, and the casual and conversational. The idea is to explore your psychology, and explore other people's psychology, and explore other people's worldviews. And explore them across different situations, contexts, and questions. The whole point of the questions is to flesh out people's worldviews and perspectives through different questions.

**Q5.2: Key phrases to develop for brand vocabulary:**

Current 9takes language:

- "See the emotions behind every take"
- "One situation, 9 ways to see it"
- "Personality maxing"
- "Perspective-taking"
- "The mental gym"

What resonates? What needs refinement? What's missing?

Answer: these are all good. One theme that I want to mention is that people think they're either similar to other people or different from other people. In reality, it's a spectrum. We are both similar and different to people, and the whole idea of personality is that there are certain aspects in which we are similar to people and there are certain aspects where we are very different from people. This is important to understand. And once you realize this, this insight should drive curiosity.

**Q5.3: How should we frame the Enneagram to new users?**

- As a tool for understanding yourself
- As a tool for understanding others
- As both equally
- As a competitive advantage ("decode people")
- As self-improvement tech

Answer: it's a tool for understanding yourself and others, but it can also be as a competitive advantage.
