## Quick Reference: AI Search Optimization

### What Makes Content "AI-Friendly"

1. **Direct answers** in first 2 sentences
2. **Numbered lists** and bullet points
3. **Tables** for comparisons
4. **Clear headers** that match search queries
5. **Authoritative language** (no hedging)
6. **FAQ sections** with real questions
7. **Updated dates**

### Replace Hedging Language

| Find             | Replace With             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| "may experience" | "commonly experience"    |
| "tend to have"   | "frequently display"     |
| "might struggle" | "often struggle"         |
| "can develop"    | "are at higher risk for" |
