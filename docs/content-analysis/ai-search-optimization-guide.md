## ü§ñ Understanding AI Search Behavior

### How AI Systems Select & Present Your Content:

1. **Scanning Phase**: AI looks for clear structure and headers
2. **Extraction Phase**: AI pulls specific answers to queries
3. **Attribution Phase**: AI cites sources with clear, authoritative content
4. **Ranking Phase**: AI prefers comprehensive, well-structured sources

### What Makes Content "AI-Friendly":

- **Direct answers** in first 2 sentences of sections
- **Numbered lists** and bullet points
- **Tables** for comparisons
- **Clear headers** that match search queries
- **Authoritative language** without hedging
- **FAQ sections** with real questions
- **Updated dates** and author information

- "What Is Enneagram Type 1 Perfectionism?"
- "Signs You're an Unhealthy Type 2"
- "How to Stop Type 3 Workaholism"
- "Why Type 4s Feel Different From Everyone"

**In this guide:**

- [Specific outcome 1]
- [Specific outcome 2]
- [Specific outcome 3]

**Read time:** X minutes | **Last updated:** [Date]
```
