| Word count        | ~1,200  | ~3,400                                                            |
| Tables            | 0       | 3 (filter table, quick ref, scenarios)                            |
| Scripts           | 0       | 27 (3 per type)                                                   |
| Childhood mapping | None    | All 9 types                                                       |
| Quick Answer      | Missing | Added                                                             |
| Internal links    | 0       | 15+ (styles, stress, relationships, toxic traits, all type pages) |

**Differentiation achieved:** `communication-styles.md` = understanding WHY each type communicates differently. `communication-tips.md` = tactical scripts for WHAT to say in specific scenarios.
