**Created**: October 2025

---

## üìä THE DATA TELLS A CLEAR STORY

### Your Winners (Keep and Enhance):

- **Mental health content** - Your top performer (147 clicks)
- **"Toxic traits" content** - People want the shadow side (42 clicks)
- **Cross-system comparisons** - Astrology + Enneagram works (31 clicks)
- **Practical guides** - "Biggest compliments" type content (21 clicks)

### Your Underperformers (Need Fixing):

- **Individual type posts** - Getting 0-5 clicks despite being comprehensive
- **Wings guide** - 628 impressions but 0 clicks (title/meta problem)
- **Relationship content** - Too much overlap, poor titles

### The Revelation:

**People search for problems, not personality descriptions**

## üéØ YOUR 3-WEEK ACTION PLAN

### Week 1: Fix What's Almost Working

**Goal**: Turn high-impression/zero-click pages into traffic drivers

1. **Rewrite these 5 titles/meta descriptions** (Monday-Tuesday):
   - enneagram-wings-complete-guide (628 impressions, 0 clicks)
   - enneagram-anxiety-complete-guide (471 impressions, 0 clicks)
   - enneagram-type-4 (394 impressions, 0 clicks)
   - enneagram-strengths-and-weaknesses (1,002 impressions, 8 clicks)
   - enneagram-types-in-stress (912 impressions, 2 clicks)

2. **Optimize your top 3 performers for AI** (Wednesday-Friday):
   - Add "Quick Answer" boxes
   - Remove hedging language ("tend to" ‚Üí "commonly")
   - Add structured FAQ sections with real search queries
   - Include comparison tables

### Week 2: Implement AI Search Features

**Goal**: Become the go-to source for AI systems

3. **Add AI-friendly structures** to all high-traffic pages:
   - Direct answer in first 2 sentences
   - Numbered lists and bullet points
   - Tables for comparisons
   - "Key Takeaways" boxes

4. **Update FAQ sections** with actual search queries:
   - "Why am I so critical?" (not "What is Type 1?")
   - "Is perfectionism OCD?" (not "What do Type 1s fear?")
   - "How to stop people-pleasing?" (not "What is Type 2?")

### Week 3: Create New Problem-Focused Content

**Goal**: Expand what's already working

5. **Develop new mental health content**:
   - "Enneagram and ADHD: Which Types Are Most Affected?"
   - "Is Your Enneagram Type Making You Anxious?"
   - "Enneagram Depression Patterns: Type-Specific Warning Signs"

6. **Create more "shadow" content**:
   - "Red Flags You're Dating Each Enneagram Type"
   - "How Each Enneagram Type Self-Sabotages Success"
   - "Manipulation Tactics by Enneagram Type"

### 1. Fix Your Best Page's Opening (15 minutes)

On `enneagram-and-mental-illness`, add this at the very top:

```markdown
## Quick Answer

**Can your Enneagram type indicate mental health risks?** Yes, certain Enneagram types show higher correlations with specific mental health conditions. Type 1s often experience OCD-like symptoms, Type 4s have higher rates of depression, and Type 6s commonly struggle with anxiety disorders.
```

### 2. Fix Wings Guide Title (5 minutes)

Change from: "The Complete Guide to Enneagram Wings"
To: "Am I 4w3 or 4w5? How to Find Your Enneagram Wing Type"

### 3. Remove Hedging from Top Pages (30 minutes)

Find and replace in your top 5 pages:

- "tend to" ‚Üí "typically"
- "might" ‚Üí "often"
- "can be" ‚Üí "are"
- "may experience" ‚Üí "commonly experience"

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS TO REMEMBER

### What's Working:

1. **Mental health angle** - Your strongest content area
2. **Negative/shadow content** - People want to understand problems
3. **Practical applications** - Specific, actionable content
4. **Cross-system comparisons** - Connecting to other frameworks

### What's Not Working:

1. **Academic type descriptions** - No search volume
2. **Generic titles** - Poor CTR despite impressions
3. **Hedging language** - Weakens authority for AI
4. **Template repetition** - Not the main issue (these pages get no traffic anyway)

### The Big Shift:

**From**: "Here's what Type 1 is like..."
**To**: "Here's why you can't stop criticizing yourself..."

## üé¨ FINAL THOUGHTS

Your Enneagram content is comprehensive and well-researched. The issue isn't quality - it's positioning and discoverability.

**The data reveals three critical pivots:**

1. **Focus on problems over descriptions** (mental health, toxic traits)
2. **Optimize for AI search** (structure, clarity, authority)
3. **Fix titles before content** (your 0-click problem is about headlines)

**Don't waste time on:**

- Rewriting the type posts (they're not getting traffic anyway)
- Celebrity content (you said it's current in Supabase)
- Perfect prose (clear, direct language wins)

**Focus everything on:**

- Making your top performers even stronger
- Fixing high-impression/low-click pages
- Creating more problem-focused content

The shift from "personality encyclopedia" to "personality problem solver" will transform your traffic.
