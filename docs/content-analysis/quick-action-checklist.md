## 💡 Fresh Opening Examples to Try

### Instead of: "The child makes a mistake..."

**Type 2**: Start with dialogue

> "Let me help you with that."
> "I'm fine, really."
> "No, I insist."

**Type 5**: Start with observation

> In a room of 20 people, 19 are talking. One is calculating the exact moment they can leave without being noticed.

**Type 8**: Start with confrontation

> The meeting was supposed to last an hour. It lasted five minutes. The Type 8 had heard enough.

**Type 9**: Start with absence

> Everyone remembered the party. No one remembered if the Type 9 was there.
