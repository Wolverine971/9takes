_Purpose: Instructions for AI agents to update blogs to meet 9takes quality standards_

---

## Quality Standards Summary

Before updating any blog, review these requirements:

### Writing Style Requirements

1. **Reading Level**: Target Grade 6-8, but this is a guideline, not a hard rule. Psychology and SEO keywords (like "self-sabotage," "perfectionism," "imposter syndrome," "attachment styles") should be kept and explained naturally. The goal is accessibility, not dumbing things down. Write like a smart friend explaining something, not a textbook or a children's book.
2. **No Em Dashes**: Replace all em dashes (—) with periods, commas, or rewrite sentences
3. **Simple Language**: Avoid unnecessarily fancy words like "quintessentially," "manifestation," "psychological architecture." However, standard psychology terms that readers search for are valuable. Keep them but explain them in plain language the first time they appear.
4. **Natural Flow**: Should sound like a person talking, not AI-generated
5. **Short Sentences**: Mix short punchy sentences with medium ones
6. **No Hedging**: Remove "perhaps," "somewhat," "might," "tend to"

### Structural Requirements

1. **QuickAnswer Box**: Must have one at the top for SEO
2. **Tables**: One table every 300-400 words or where it is natural to do so
3. **Engagement Devices**: Use 💡 ⚠️ ❓ 🎯 callouts naturally throughout
4. **Internal Links**: 3-5 links to related content
5. **Clear CTA**: End with actionable next step or link to another tangentially related blog to dive deeper
6. **FAQs**: Include 3-5 FAQs at bottom, where it is natural

### Content Requirements

1. **Balanced Perspective**: Show both strengths AND shadow/costs for each type
2. **Childhood Origins**: Connect patterns to childhood roots
3. **Practical Application**: Give readers something to DO with the info
4. **Specific Examples**: Concrete scenarios, not abstract theory

## Blog #1: How Each Enneagram Type Self-Sabotages Success

**File**: `src/blog/enneagram/how-each-enneagram-type-self-sabotages-success.md`
**Status**: Published
**Priority**: High (good SEO potential)

### Current Issues

1. **Language too complex**: Uses phrases like "protection mechanism," "neural pathways," "psychological necessity"
2. **Em dashes present**: Multiple instances throughout (e.g., "—" used for asides)
3. **Some sections feel clinical**: Reads like a psychology textbook, not a conversation
4. **Missing engagement devices**: No 💡 ⚠️ ❓ callouts
5. **Could use more relatability**: Add more "you've probably done this" moments

### What to Update

- [ ] Simplify language while keeping SEO psychology terms (explain them naturally)
- [ ] Remove all em dashes, rewrite those sentences
- [ ] Add 💡 insight callouts after each type's childhood section
- [ ] Add ⚠️ warning callouts for "when this goes too far"
- [ ] Make the intro hook more conversational
- [ ] Add a "Which pattern sounds like you?" self-check section
- [ ] Ensure each type section has a relatable real-world example

### Research to Make It Great

**Search for and incorporate:**

1. **Reddit threads**: Search r/Enneagram for "self sabotage" + each type number. Find real stories people share about their patterns.
2. **Statistics**: Find data on procrastination rates, perfectionism prevalence, workaholism stats
3. **Psychology research**: Look up "fear of success" studies, imposter syndrome research
4. **Celebrity examples**: Find famous people who've talked about their self-sabotage (interviews, podcasts)
5. **Book quotes**: Pull relevant quotes from Enneagram books (Wisdom of the Enneagram, The Road Back to You)

**Questions to answer:**

- What does each type's self-sabotage look like in a workplace meeting?
- What does it look like in a romantic relationship?
- What's the ONE thing each type could do TODAY to interrupt the pattern?

## Blog #2: Toxic Traits of Each Enneagram Type

**File**: `src/blog/enneagram/toxic-traits-of-each-enneagram-type.md`
**Status**: Published
**Priority**: High (gets traffic, needs polish)

### Current Issues

1. **Strong opening but uneven depth**: Some type sections are better than others
2. **Language varies**: Some sections are simple, others get complex
3. **Missing "what to do about it"**: Tells people the problem but not the solution
4. **Could be more balanced**: Leans negative without redemption arc
5. **Em dashes present**: Multiple throughout

### What to Update

- [ ] Even out the depth across all 9 types
- [ ] Add "How to deal with this person" for each type
- [ ] Add "If YOU have this trait" self-help section for each type
- [ ] Simplify complex sentences
- [ ] Remove em dashes
- [ ] Add engagement devices (💡 ⚠️ ❓)
- [ ] Add a "recovery" or "growth" angle so it's not just negative

### Research to Make It Great

**Search for and incorporate:**

1. **Relationship forums**: How do people describe toxic behavior from partners/family?
2. **Therapy content**: What do therapists say about these patterns?
3. **Real examples**: Find public figures who've exhibited these traits (with care—not to attack but to illustrate)
4. **Boundary-setting scripts**: What to actually SAY to someone displaying these traits
5. **Self-awareness questions**: Questions each type can ask themselves to catch the behavior

**Questions to answer:**

- What triggers each type's toxic behavior? (stress, insecurity, feeling attacked?)
- What's the difference between "occasional bad day" vs "chronic pattern"?
- How can someone who HAS this trait start to change?

**File**: `src/blog/enneagram/enneagram-types-being-ghosted.md`
**Status**: Published
**Priority**: Medium (good topic, needs freshening)

1. **Decent structure but language needs simplifying**
2. **Some clinical phrasing**: "emotional demands exceeded capacity"
3. **Could be more empathetic**: People reading this are hurting
4. **Missing the "ghoster's perspective"**: Why each type ghosts others (not just how they handle being ghosted)
5. **Em dashes present**

- [ ] Expand "why each type ghosts" section (the table is good, needs more detail)
- [ ] Add "how to get closure when you won't get answers"
- [ ] Remove em dashes
- [ ] Add engagement devices
- [ ] Make healing paths more specific and actionable

### Research to Make It Great

**Search for and incorporate:**

2. **Reddit threads**: r/dating, r/relationships posts about being ghosted—real emotional language
3. **Psychology of ghosting**: Why do people ghost instead of communicating?
4. **Attachment theory connection**: How attachment styles relate to ghosting behavior
5. **Closure without answers**: How do you move on when you never get an explanation?

**Questions to answer:**

## Example Transformations

### Before (Too Complex)

"Your Enneagram type has a core fear that creates a protective pattern. When that pattern gets triggered—often unconsciously—you prioritize emotional safety over success."

### After (Simple)

"Your personality type has a fear at its core. That fear creates a pattern. When something triggers that pattern, you choose feeling safe over getting ahead. You don't even realize you're doing it."

### Before (Em Dash)

"Type 2s give and give and give—but it's rarely without strings attached."

### After (No Em Dash)

"Type 2s give and give and give. But it's rarely without strings attached."
