# Blog Update Queue

_Created: 2025-12-31_
_Purpose: Instructions for AI agents to update blogs to meet 9takes quality standards_

---

## Quality Standards Summary

Before updating any blog, review these requirements:

### Writing Style Requirements

1. **Reading Level**: Target Grade 6-8, but this is a guideline, not a hard rule. Psychology and SEO keywords (like "self-sabotage," "perfectionism," "imposter syndrome," "attachment styles") should be kept and explained naturally. The goal is accessibility, not dumbing things down. Write like a smart friend explaining something, not a textbook or a children's book.
2. **No Em Dashes**: Replace all em dashes (—) with periods, commas, or rewrite sentences
3. **Simple Language**: Avoid unnecessarily fancy words like "quintessentially," "manifestation," "psychological architecture." However, standard psychology terms that readers search for are valuable. Keep them but explain them in plain language the first time they appear.
4. **Natural Flow**: Should sound like a person talking, not AI-generated
5. **Short Sentences**: Mix short punchy sentences with medium ones
6. **No Hedging**: Remove "perhaps," "somewhat," "might," "tend to"

### Structural Requirements

1. **QuickAnswer Box**: Must have one at the top for SEO
2. **Tables**: One table every 300-400 words or where it is natural to do so
3. **Engagement Devices**: Use 💡 ⚠️ ❓ 🎯 callouts naturally throughout
4. **Internal Links**: 3-5 links to related content
5. **Clear CTA**: End with actionable next step or link to another tangentially related blog to dive deeper
6. **FAQs**: Include 3-5 FAQs at bottom, where it is natural

### Content Requirements

1. **Balanced Perspective**: Show both strengths AND shadow/costs for each type
2. **Childhood Origins**: Connect patterns to childhood roots
3. **Practical Application**: Give readers something to DO with the info
4. **Specific Examples**: Concrete scenarios, not abstract theory

## Example Transformations

### Before (Too Complex)

"Your Enneagram type has a core fear that creates a protective pattern. When that pattern gets triggered—often unconsciously—you prioritize emotional safety over success."

### After (Simple)

"Your personality type has a fear at its core. That fear creates a pattern. When something triggers that pattern, you choose feeling safe over getting ahead. You don't even realize you're doing it."

### Before (Em Dash)

"Type 2s give and give and give—but it's rarely without strings attached."

### After (No Em Dash)

"Type 2s give and give and give. But it's rarely without strings attached."
