## Image Implementation Notes:

1. **File Naming Convention:**
   - Main images: `[topic]-hero.webp`
   - Section images: `[topic]-[section].webp`
   - Social media: `[topic]-social-[platform].webp`

2. **Optimization Requirements:**
   - Convert all to WebP format
   - Compress to under 200KB for hero images
   - Create responsive versions (mobile/desktop)
   - Add descriptive alt text for accessibility

3. **Brand Consistency:**
   - Maintain 9takes visual style (sophisticated, psychological depth)
   - Use consistent color palette across related images
   - Ensure images work with both light/dark themes

4. **Where to Add Images in Blogs:**

   **Positive Self-Talk:**
   - Hero image after opening paragraph
   - Optional: One image per "center" section (Body/Heart/Head)
   - Optional: Rewiring brain visualization before neuroscience section

   **Anxiety Management:**
   - Hero image after opening paragraph
   - Three Centers diagram after that section
   - Optional: Crisis protocols visual before that section
   - Optional: Growth edge illustration near conclusion

## Prompt Engineering Tips:

1. **For Consistency:** Add `--seed [number]` to maintain style across variations
2. **For Quality:** Always use `--v 6` for latest model
3. **For Format:** Use `--ar 16:9` for blog heroes, `--ar 1:1` for social media
4. **Style Modifiers:** Add `photorealistic`, `cinematic`, or `illustration` based on needs

## Testing Prompts:

Before generating final images, test with:

- `--quality .5` for quick previews
- Adjust lighting/mood with terms like `golden hour`, `dramatic shadows`, `soft ambient light`
- Refine with style references: `in the style of [artist/movement]`

## Backup Generic Options:

If custom generation isn't possible, search for:

- "meditation visualization" + "personality types"
- "neural pathways" + "transformation"
- "emotional weather patterns"
- "inner dialogue illustration"
- "anxiety management infographic"

These should be modified with overlays showing:

- Nine dots/symbols for Enneagram types
- Color coding for three centers
- 9takes branding elements
