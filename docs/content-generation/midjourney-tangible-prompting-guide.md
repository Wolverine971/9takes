# Midjourney Tangible Prompting Guide for 90-Day Transformation Blog

## Core Principle: Concrete Moments, Not Abstract Concepts

Midjourney cannot visualize abstract concepts like "transformation" or "growth." Instead, capture **specific moments in time** that represent these concepts through tangible scenes, objects, and people.

## Formula for Success

**[Subject/Person] + [Specific Action] + [Environment] + [Concrete Details] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Technical Specs]**

## Key Prompting Tips

### DO's:

- Describe specific physical actions and poses
- Include tangible objects that symbolize change
- Use environmental storytelling (before/after spaces)
- Specify lighting conditions and time of day
- Add concrete details like clothing, objects, settings
- Include technical photography terms

### DON'Ts:

- Use abstract terms like "transformation," "growth," "evolution"
- Describe emotions directly - show them through body language
- Create impossible or surreal scenarios
- Mix too many metaphorical elements
- Use vague descriptions like "journey" or "path"

- Soft morning light (fresh starts, hope)
- Dramatic side lighting (transformation)
- Backlighting (breakthrough moments)

## Testing Your Prompts

Before using a prompt, ask yourself:

1. Can I physically photograph this scene in real life?
2. Are all elements concrete and tangible?
3. Does the scene tell a story through objects and actions?
4. Would a photographer understand exactly what to capture?

## Example Prompt Evolution

❌ **Too Abstract:**
"Personality transformation journey from darkness to light over 90 days"

✅ **Tangible Version:**
"Before and after desk setup photos, left side: cluttered desk with empty coffee cups, crumpled papers, stress ball, pill bottles, harsh fluorescent lighting; right side: same desk 90 days later with organized notebooks labeled by week, green plant, water bottle, natural sunlight, completed project portfolio, productivity photography style --ar 16:9 --v 6"

Remember: Every abstract concept can be represented through a concrete moment, action, or scene. Think like a photographer, not a philosopher.
