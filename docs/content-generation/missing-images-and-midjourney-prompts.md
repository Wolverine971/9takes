## Updated Midjourney Prompts (More Concrete & Specific)

### 1. Shadow Work Main Image

**Filename:** nine_greek_statues_facing_their_shadows_on_the_wall.webp

**Updated Prompt:**

```
Nine ancient Greek marble statues standing in a semicircle formation inside a temple, each statue positioned 3 feet apart, all facing a large flat stone wall. Each statue casts a distinct dark shadow on the wall. The first statue on the left is in a proud standing pose but its shadow shows hunched shoulders and clenched fists. The second statue has arms open in a welcoming pose but its shadow shows hands grasping desperately. The third statue stands tall with a victory pose but its shadow appears to be hiding behind a mask. The fourth statue has one hand on its heart but the shadow shows tears streaming down. Continue this pattern where each statue's physical pose contrasts with its shadow's emotion. Golden hour sunlight streaming through temple columns from the left creates these long dramatic shadows. Classical Greek temple interior with marble columns visible. Photorealistic style, cinematic lighting --ar 16:9 --v 6

Fourth pair - two statues sitting on a bench, one speaking with animated hand gestures while the other leans in listening intently. Fifth statue stands alone holding a flower and gazing at it tenderly.

## Notes for Image Generation

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Removed abstract symbolism** - Instead of "showing perfectionism," the statue is physically straightening silverware
2. **Added specific physical actions** - Each statue is doing something concrete and visible
3. **Detailed environmental context** - Specific restaurant/cafe types that match each personality
4. **Clear spatial relationships** - Specified where statues are positioned and what they're doing
5. **Concrete objects** - Added specific props like gift boxes, books, tablets, menu items
6. **Lighting specifications** - Detailed lighting that creates the right mood for each type

### Generation Tips:

- Generate at high resolution for web optimization
- Ensure consistent Greek statue aesthetic across all images
- Maintain photorealistic marble texture
- Keep color palette muted to match website design
- Export as WebP with quality setting of 85-90 for optimal file size

### Priority Order:

1. Shadow work main image (most prominent placement)
2. Love languages main image
3. Type dating images 1-9 (generate as a batch for consistency)
