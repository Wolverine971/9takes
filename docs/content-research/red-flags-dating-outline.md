## Quick Answer Box (~50 words)

```markdown
<div class="quick-answer">

**Quick Answer:** Every Enneagram type has predictable relationship red flags rooted in their core fears. Type 1s criticize constantly, Type 2s keep score, Type 8s dominate. Recognizing these patterns helps you distinguish between someone having a bad day and someone who will make your life miserable.

## Opening Hook (~150 words)

```markdown
<p class="firstLetter">That charming confidence? Might be Type 3 image management. The intense emotional connection? Could be Type 4 drama addiction. The protectiveness? Possibly Type 8 control.</p>

**The most dangerous relationship red flags don't look like red flags at first.**

They look like attractive qualities—until they're not.

Every personality type has a shadow side that emerges in relationships. The Enneagram reveals exactly what that shadow looks like for each type, why it develops, and most importantly: how to recognize it before you're in too deep.

This isn't about labeling people as "bad." It's about understanding patterns—so you can protect yourself and make informed choices about who deserves your heart.

Here are the red flags for each type, what causes them, and what to do if you spot them.

### Type 1: The Perfectionist – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their integrity, reliability, and moral compass. They seemed like someone who would do the right thing no matter what. Their high standards felt like a sign they'd never let you down.

**The Red Flags:**

- Constant criticism disguised as "helping you improve"
- Rigid rules about the "right way" to do everything
- Unable to relax without finding something wrong
- Silent resentment that explodes unexpectedly
- Making you feel like you're never quite good enough
- Controlling behavior justified as "doing what's correct"

**Why This Happens:**
Type 1s have a brutal inner critic that never stops. When stressed, they project that critic onto you—believing they're helping when they're actually crushing you.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I appreciate you wanting things to be better. But when you point out what's wrong, I feel criticized instead of helped. Can we talk about what's going well first?"

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 1:** Accepts imperfection, offers balanced feedback
- **Unhealthy 1:** Makes you feel perpetually flawed and inadequate

---

### Type 2: The Helper – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their warmth, attentiveness, and how they made you feel special. They seemed to anticipate your needs before you even knew them. Finally, someone who cared.

**The Red Flags:**

- Giving with strings attached (keeping score)
- Making you feel guilty for not needing them enough
- Ignoring your boundaries with "helpful" intrusions
- Martyrdom: "After everything I do for you!"
- Triangulating: being everyone's savior
- Emotional manipulation through guilt

**Why This Happens:**
Type 2s learned love must be earned through giving. When they give and don't receive what they expect back, resentment builds behind a caring smile.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I love what you do for me, but I need to know it's freely given. When I feel like I owe you something, it creates distance instead of closeness."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 2:** Gives freely, respects your autonomy
- **Unhealthy 2:** Uses giving as a control mechanism

---

### Type 3: The Achiever – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their confidence, success, and how they made you feel like you were with someone important. They were charming, driven, and seemed to have it all figured out.

**The Red Flags:**

- Image management (you're a trophy, not a partner)
- Workaholism that leaves no room for connection
- Lying or exaggerating to maintain their image
- Competing with you instead of supporting you
- Emotional unavailability (feelings = weakness)
- Being a different person with different audiences

**Why This Happens:**
Type 3s learned they're only valuable for what they achieve. The relationship becomes another achievement to manage, not a place to be authentic.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I'm not impressed by your success—I'm impressed by who you are when no one's watching. I need to see that person more."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 3:** Vulnerable, authentic, fully present
- **Unhealthy 3:** Performing constantly, even in intimacy

---

### Type 4: The Individualist – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their depth, emotional intensity, and ability to see you like no one else. They made ordinary moments feel profound. Finally, someone who understood real feelings.

**The Red Flags:**

- Emotional volatility (everything becomes a crisis)
- Push-pull dynamics (intense pursuit then sudden withdrawal)
- Comparing your relationship to an idealized fantasy
- Making everything about their feelings
- Chronic dissatisfaction: "Something is missing"
- Using melancholy to demand attention

**Why This Happens:**
Type 4s believe something is fundamentally wrong with them. They chase emotional intensity trying to feel "complete"—but no relationship can provide that.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I can't compete with a fantasy. I'm real, and I'm here. If that's not enough, I need to know."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 4:** Emotionally deep but stable and grounded
- **Unhealthy 4:** Addicted to drama, chronically dissatisfied

---

### Type 5: The Investigator – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their intelligence, independence, and fascinating inner world. They didn't need you—which made them intriguing. You wanted to be let into their mind.

**The Red Flags:**

- Extreme withdrawal (disappearing for days)
- Emotional unavailability (intellectualizing all feelings)
- Hoarding time and energy at relationship's expense
- Making you feel like a burden
- Compartmentalizing you out of their "real" life
- Using intellectual superiority to create distance

**Why This Happens:**
Type 5s protect themselves by minimizing needs. They learned resources (time, energy, love) were scarce—so they hoard them, even from you.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I understand you need space. But I also need to feel like I'm part of your life, not an interruption to it."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 5:** Present, shares their inner world
- **Unhealthy 5:** Fortress mentality, you're outside the walls

---

### Type 6: The Loyalist – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their loyalty, commitment, and how seriously they took the relationship. They weren't playing games. They wanted security as much as you did.

**The Red Flags:**

- Constantly testing your loyalty
- Worst-case-scenario spiraling about the relationship
- Suspicion without cause
- Flip-flopping between trust and doubt
- Needing reassurance that's never enough
- Projecting fear: "You're going to leave me"

**Why This Happens:**
Type 6s learned the world is dangerous and people can't be trusted. Their anxiety makes them see threats everywhere—including in you.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I understand you're afraid. But constantly questioning my commitment makes me feel like nothing I do matters. I need you to trust my actions."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 6:** Loyal, courageous, trusting
- **Unhealthy 6:** Paranoid, accusatory, smothering

---

### Type 7: The Enthusiast – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their optimism, spontaneity, and how they made everything feel exciting. Life felt like an adventure with them. They were a breath of fresh air.

**The Red Flags:**

- Avoiding serious conversations
- Commitment phobia (always keeping options open)
- Minimizing your problems: "Just be positive!"
- Scattered attention (you're one of many interests)
- Impulsivity that affects your stability
- Running when things get hard

**Why This Happens:**
Type 7s learned to escape pain through positivity and distraction. Anything that threatens their freedom or forces them to feel pain triggers flight mode.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I love your optimism. But sometimes I need you to sit with me in hard moments, not fix them or escape them."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 7:** Present, committed, handles difficulty
- **Unhealthy 7:** Escapist, unreliable, emotionally avoidant

---

### Type 8: The Challenger – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their strength, confidence, and how protected you felt around them. They were a rock. They took charge. They made you feel safe.

**The Red Flags:**

- Dominating conversations and decisions
- Anger as their default emotional expression
- "My way or the highway" attitude
- Dismissing your feelings as weakness
- Power plays within the relationship
- Inability to admit being wrong

**Why This Happens:**
Type 8s learned that vulnerability equals danger. They equate control with safety—so they control everything, including you.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I feel safest with you when you're strong AND soft. When you only show me strength, I feel controlled, not protected."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 8:** Protective, vulnerable with you, respects your strength
- **Unhealthy 8:** Controlling, intimidating, dismissive

---

### Type 9: The Peacemaker – Red Flags to Watch

**What Drew You In:**
Their calm, accepting presence. They didn't judge. They went with the flow. Being around them felt peaceful and easy.

**The Red Flags:**

- Passive aggression instead of direct communication
- "Going along to get along" then resenting you
- Numbing out (physically present, emotionally absent)
- Procrastinating on important relationship issues
- Stubbornness disguised as agreeableness
- Making you the bad guy for having needs

**Why This Happens:**
Type 9s learned their needs don't matter and conflict must be avoided at all costs. They merge with you to keep the peace—then lose themselves and resent you for it.

**What to Do:**
Say: "I need to hear what YOU want, not what you think will keep me happy. Your preferences matter to me."

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy:**

- **Healthy 9:** Present, assertive, actively engaged
- **Unhealthy 9:** Checked out, passive-aggressive, stubbornly inert
