## THE NEW PERSONALITY MAXING FRAMEWORK

### Core Philosophy Shift

**OLD APPROACH:** Generic 90-day type-specific protocols (what everyone does)
**NEW APPROACH:** Personality = Understanding how you're similar AND different from others

### The 5-Phase Personality Maxing System

This is 9takes' unique framework that NO competitor has:

| Phase            | Focus                                      | Core Question                                        | Key Content Needed                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. DEFINE**    | What IS personality?                       | "How am I similar/different from specific people?"   | NEW: "Personality Begins with Comparison"                |
| **2. DOCUMENT**  | Self-observation vs. external perception   | "How do I see myself vs. how do others see me?"      | NEW: "The Personality Baseline Assessment"               |
| **3. DISCOVER**  | Identify superpowers via Enneagram         | "What are my organic, authentic strengths?"          | LINK: beginners-guide-to-determining-your-enneagram-type |
| **4. DIVE DEEP** | Strengths (security) + Weaknesses (stress) | "What am I feeling/thinking/doing at best/worst?"    | PARTIAL: shadow-work, NEW: arrow-of-security guide       |
| **5. DEPLOY**    | Apply understanding to others → Charisma   | "What makes someone genuinely curious about others?" | NEW: "Personality-Based Charisma Model"                  |

### The 9takes Differentiator

**Our Unique Angle:** Charisma = Self-knowledge + Genuine curiosity about others + Knowing when to assert vs. listen

Most personality content stops at Phase 3 (identify your type). We go further:

- Phase 4: Therapeutic depth (triggers, shame, anxiety)
- Phase 5: Social intelligence and genuine curiosity

## CRITICAL CONTENT GAPS (REVISED)

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Rewrite 90-Day Blueprint

**Current Problem:** The existing 90-day blueprint jumps straight into type-specific protocols without the foundational framework from your notes.

**New Structure:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Phase 1 - Define (comparison exercises)
2. **Week 3-4:** Phase 2 - Document (baseline assessment, external feedback)
3. **Week 5-8:** Phase 3 - Discover (Enneagram typing + strengths)
4. **Week 9-12:** Phase 4 - Dive Deep (arrow of security + stress)
5. **Week 13:** Phase 5 - Deploy (charisma application)

### 🔴 NEW CONTENT: Phase 1 Deep Dive

**"Personality Begins with Comparison"**

- Why personality = how you're similar/different from others
- Exercise: Compare yourself to 3 specific people
- Exercise: Compare yourself to "most people"
- Homework: Video yourself answering these questions
- This positions 9takes as doing something NO ONE else does

### 🔴 NEW CONTENT: Arrow of Security Guide

**"Your Arrow of Security: What Your Comfort Zone Reveals"**

- Each type's security point explained
- Feeling/Thinking/Doing breakdown at security
- How to intentionally access your "best self" state
- Connects to existing stress content as the opposite energy

### 🔴 NEW CONTENT: Charisma Model (DIFFERENTIATOR)

**"The Personality-Based Charisma Model"**

- Why personality tests don't make you charismatic (but could)
- The 3 components: Self-knowledge + Curiosity + Timing
- Genuine curiosity about other people's experiences
- When to assert vs. when to listen (by type)
- Connects to existing social content (first impressions, parties)

## RESEARCH TO INTEGRATE

### External Authorities to Reference

| Authority             | Their Framework                 | How to Integrate                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Brené Brown**       | Shame resilience, vulnerability | Phase 4 - emotional triggers, shame work    |
| **Andrew Huberman**   | Stress physiology, dopamine     | Phase 4 - science of stress/security states |
| **Beatrice Chestnut** | Subtypes, development levels    | Phase 3 - deeper Enneagram specificity      |
| **Ian Morgan Cron**   | Relational Enneagram            | Phase 5 - charisma and connection           |
| **Carl Jung**         | Shadow work, archetypes         | Phase 4 - best/worst version archetypes     |

### Unique Research Opportunities

- **Your notes mention "archetype"**: Best/worst version of each type → could be standalone content
- **"Protocols & Common Sabotages"**: Research what top therapists recommend by type
- **Feeling/Thinking/Doing matrix**: Create detailed breakdown for all 9 types at security AND stress

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (REVISED)

### Who's Competing:

| Competitor               | Their Angle             | What They Miss               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Mark Manson**          | Self-help + personality | No type-specific depth       |
| **Jordan Peterson**      | Meaning + Big 5         | Not Enneagram-based          |
| **Tim Ferriss**          | Optimization tactics    | No personality framework     |
| **Enneagram Institute**  | Type descriptions       | No optimization/maxing angle |
| **Personality Database** | Typing celebrities      | No transformation system     |

### 9takes Unique Position:

**"The only site that connects Enneagram self-knowledge to genuine charisma and social intelligence"**

- **Phase 1-2:** We start with comparison (no one else does this)
- **Phase 3:** We use established Enneagram (credibility)
- **Phase 4:** We go therapeutic depth (arrows, shadows)
- **Phase 5:** We connect to charisma (the payoff no one offers)

## SEO STRATEGY (REVISED)

### Primary Keywords to Own:

| Keyword                   | Volume    | Current Content                  | Gap             |
| ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| "personality development" | 14,800/mo | personality-maxing.md            | Strengthen      |
| "shadow work"             | 74,000/mo | shadow-work-by-enneagram-type.md | ✅ Strong       |
| "self improvement plan"   | 33,100/mo | 90-day-blueprint.md              | Rewrite needed  |
| "how to be charismatic"   | 8,100/mo  | NONE                             | NEW OPPORTUNITY |
| "personality change"      | 9,900/mo  | NONE                             | Phase 1 content |
| "arrow of integration"    | 1,000/mo  | NONE                             | Phase 4 content |

### Long-Tail Opportunities:

- "how to understand your personality" → Phase 1-2
- "enneagram growth arrows" → Phase 4
- "why personality tests don't work" → Phase 1 (contrarian)
- "how to be genuinely curious about people" → Phase 5

## NOTES FROM ORIGINAL VISION

Key insights from notes that must be preserved:

> "The bottom line toward the end is that given that we are all similar and different we should be genuinely curious about other people. In order to max out your personality you need to be genuinely curious about those around you."

This is the thesis. Everything builds to Phase 5: genuine curiosity about others.

> "This lays the foundation for being charismatic. A charismatic person understands others and understands themselves and is ready for both the good and bad. They are genuine, and genuinely curious about the other people around. They take the time to ask good questions and listen to other people. They know when and where to assert themselves and where and when to be passive and listen."

This is the payoff. No one else connects Enneagram to charisma this way.
