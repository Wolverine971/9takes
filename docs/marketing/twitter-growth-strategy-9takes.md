# Twitter Growth Strategy for @9takesdotcom

- **Goal**: Build thought leadership + drive traffic to 9takes
- **Frequency**: 3-4x per week
- **Strategy**: Value-first growth with delayed CTAs

## Core Growth Strategy: "The Authority Builder"

### Why This Will Work With Small Following:
1. **Questions get 3x more engagement** than statements (crucial for small accounts)
2. **Threads without links get 2x more reach** (algorithm favors native content)
3. **Reply guys become amplifiers** (engage with every response to boost visibility)
4. **Value-first builds trust** before asking for clicks

### Posting Rhythm (3-4x/week)
- **Monday**: Question/Poll to spark discussion
- **Wednesday**: Main value thread (no link)
- **Thursday/Friday**: Follow-up with link in replies
- **Saturday (optional)**: Engagement post/conversation starter

## Month 1: Foundation Building
**Theme**: "What Nobody Tells You About People"
**Goal**: Grow from 28 â†’ 150 followers

### Week 1: Hook & Establish Authority

#### Post 1: Monday @ 9 AM - Question Post
```
What's the weirdest thing you do in social situations that you think nobody notices?

I'll go first: I count how many times people check their phones during conversations.

(Spoiler: everyone has a pattern)
```
*Strategy: Get people talking about themselves*

#### Post 2: Wednesday @ 12 PM - Main Thread
```
1/ I've studied 1000+ social interactions and found something wild:

Everyone gives away their personality type in the first 30 seconds.

Here are 3 signs you're probably missing:

2/ The Perfectionist Test:
Watch their eyes when you make a small mistake.

If they physically tense or their jaw clenches slightly - you've found a Type 1.

They can't help it. Imperfection causes them physical discomfort.

3/ The Helper Test:
Mention any small problem.
"Traffic was awful" or "Coffee machine broke"

If they immediately offer solutions or help - Type 2.

They're not being nice. They're earning love through service.

4/ The Achiever Test:
Count how long before they mention work or achievements.

Under 60 seconds? Type 3.

They're not bragging. They literally believe they ARE their accomplishments.

5/ Once you see these patterns, every conversation becomes fascinating.

You stop taking things personally.
You understand what people actually need.
You connect instantly.

What patterns do you notice in people?
```
*Strategy: Pure value, no CTA, encourage discussion*

#### Post 3: Thursday @ 5 PM - Follow-up
```
That thread about reading people in 30 seconds?

The responses were incredible. So many of you see these patterns too.

For those asking for all 9 types, I went deep here: [link to first-impression-enneagram-playbook]

What type do you think you are?
```
*Strategy: Reference previous engagement, soft CTA*

### Week 2: Build on Momentum

#### Post 4: Monday @ 9 AM - Controversial Question
```
Hot take: Your personality type is why you're single.

Not your looks.
Not "all the good ones are taken."
Not bad luck.

What dating pattern do you keep repeating?
```

#### Post 5: Wednesday @ 8 AM - Story Thread
```
1/ My friend kept dating the same toxic person in different bodies.

6 relationships. Same ending. Every time.

Then she discovered her Type 2 pattern:

2/ The pattern:
- Give everything immediately
- Ignore her own needs
- Build resentment silently
- Explode "out of nowhere"
- Partner leaves confused

Every. Single. Time.

3/ Type 2s believe they earn love through giving.
So they give until empty.
Then blame others for not reciprocating.

But they never asked for anything.

4/ The fix wasn't dating "better people."

It was recognizing the pattern.
Setting boundaries.
Asking for needs to be met.
Revolutionary.

5/ We all have a pattern.
Type 8s? Dominate then wonder why no one's vulnerable.
Type 9s? Disappear then wonder why they're overlooked.

What pattern are you running?
```

#### Post 6: Friday @ 12 PM - Link Drop
```
Yesterday's thread hit a nerve.

100+ DMs asking "how do I find my pattern?"

I mapped out all 9 types and their relationship blindspots here: [link]

Reply with your type and I'll tell you your dating kryptonite ðŸ‘‡
```
*Strategy: Use DMs as social proof, personal engagement promise*

### Week 3: Deepen Engagement

#### Post 7: Monday @ 9 AM - Poll + Discussion
```
Which ruins more relationships?

ðŸ”¸ Being too clingy
ðŸ”¸ Being too distant  
ðŸ”¸ Being too critical
ðŸ”¸ Being too nice

(Your answer reveals your personality type btw)
```

#### Post 8: Wednesday @ 5 PM - Practical Thread
```
1/ Your boss's personality type determines if you'll get promoted.

Not your performance.
Not your skills.
Your ability to speak their language.

Here's the cheat code:

2/ Boss who emails at midnight with "small corrections"?
Type 1 - The Perfectionist

Never say: "Good enough"
Always say: "I've reviewed this three times"

Show process, not just results.

3/ Boss who asks "how are you?" and means it?
Type 2 - The Helper

Never be just "fine"
Share something personal (small)
Let them help you occasionally

They promote people they feel connected to.

4/ Boss who only cares about numbers?
Type 3 - The Achiever

Every conversation needs metrics
"I improved X by 30%"
Never waste their time with stories

They promote winners.

5/ Reading your boss isn't manipulation.
It's communication.

Everyone has a language.
Learn theirs or stay stuck.

What type is your boss?
```

#### Post 9: Thursday @ 9 AM - Follow-up 
```
That boss thread yesterday?

My DMs are chaos ðŸ˜…

"OMG this explains everything"
"I finally understand why I didn't get promoted"
"Sent this to my whole team"

Full guide to workplace dynamics: [link]
```

### Week 4: Community Building

#### Post 10: Monday @ 12 PM - Community Question
```
Let's play a game:

Describe your worst relationship habit in 5 words or less.

I'll guess your Enneagram type.

(I'm weirdly good at this)
```
*Strategy: Personal interaction with every reply*

#### Post 11: Wednesday @ 9 AM - Meta Thread
```
1/ I was skeptical of personality typing.

"Putting people in boxes"
"Pseudoscience"  
"Horoscopes for nerds"

Then I saw my pattern and couldn't unsee it.

2/ The Enneagram isn't about predicting behavior.

It's about understanding WHY you do what you do.

Not "You're Type 5 so you're antisocial"
But "You withdraw because you fear being overwhelmed"

3/ The difference:
Horoscopes: External (stars) determine fate
Enneagram: Internal (fears/desires) drive patterns

One you can't change.
One you can.

4/ It's not science.
It's pattern recognition.

Like how you know your friend will be late.
Or your mom will guilt trip.
Or your ex will text when you move on.

Patterns.

5/ Use it as a lens, not a label.
A map, not a destination.

Understanding patterns = power to change them.

What pattern do you wish you could break?
```

#### Post 12: Friday @ 5 PM - Week Recap
```
This week we talked about:
- Reading people in 30 seconds
- Relationship patterns
- Boss types
- Why we self-sabotage

The responses show we're all struggling with the same 9 patterns.

Deep dive into your type: [link]

What was your biggest realization this week?

## Growth Tactics for Small Accounts

### The "Reply Guy" Strategy
**Every post you make:**
1. Reply to EVERY comment within 2 hours
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Heart every response
4. Follow interesting commenters

**Why this works at 28 followers:**
- Shows you're active/engaged
- Algorithm rewards conversation
- Commenters often follow back
- Builds community feeling

### The "Big Account" Strategy
**Daily: Find 3 large accounts (10k+) in your niche**
1. Reply EARLY to their posts (within 5 min)
2. Add value, don't promote
3. Reference the Enneagram naturally
4. Build recognition over time

**Target accounts:**
- @ThePsychologyOf
- @PsychologyToday
- @relationshipquotes
- @ThreadReaders in psychology

### The "Question Engine"
**Types of questions that go viral:**
1. "What's your toxic trait?" (self-deprecating)
2. "Red flag or normal?" (opinion)
3. "Complete the sentence..." (creative)
4. "Wrong answers only" (humor)
5. "Describe your ex in 3 words" (relatable)

### The "Quote Tweet" Multiplier
**When you get good responses:**
1. Screenshot the best ones
2. Quote tweet yourself: "This response wins"
3. Creates new entry point to thread
4. Doubles the lifecycle
