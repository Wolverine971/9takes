### Option 1: Value-First Hook

Your Enneagram type is just the beginning.

Your wing is what makes you uniquely YOU.

Most people get their wing completely wrong (they ignore it, confuse behavior with motivation, or assume stronger = dominant).

I just published the complete guide to finding and using your true wing:

### Option 2: Problem/Solution

Why don't you fit your Enneagram type description perfectly?

You're not broken. You have a WING.

Your wing is your secondary drive - the adjacent number that flavors your main type.

Two Type 8s can look completely different:
‚Ä¢ 8w7: Charismatic protector
‚Ä¢ 8w9: Quiet intensity

### Option 3: Authority Positioning

After analyzing thousands of Enneagram profiles, I've discovered something crucial:

Your wing isn't a minor detail - it explains why you don't fit your main type's box.

### Option 4: Controversial Take

Hot take: Most Enneagram content is garbage because it ignores wings.

Your type + wing combination is your actual personality blueprint.

Type 4w3 ‚â† Type 4w5
Type 7w6 ‚â† Type 7w8

They're completely different flavors of human.

The most common wing mistakes:

‚ùå Changing your wing based on mood
‚ùå Ignoring wings completely

‚úÖ Your wing is consistent throughout life
‚úÖ It's about WHY you do things
‚úÖ Subtle influence can be more powerful
‚úÖ Wings don't shift - your access does

### Tweet 3 (Next day)

Which wing combination confuses people most?

Type 9w8 vs 9w1

9w8: "Sleeping giant" - peaceful until you cross their values
9w1: "Quiet perfectionist" - peaceful but with subtle standards

Both avoid conflict, but for totally different reasons.

Same core type, different worlds.
