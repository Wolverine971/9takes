# Q1 2026 Content Pipeline

_Created: December 31, 2025_
_Duration: January 1 - March 31, 2026_
_Theme: Trust Onion Outer Layer + Domain Expansion_

---

## Strategic Focus for Q1

### The Gap We're Fixing

From December analysis:

- **Top of Funnel content:** ~20% (target: 50%)
- **Trust Onion coverage:** Skipping outer layer (circumstances) → inner layer (self-reflection)
- **Reader journey:** Not meeting new readers where they are

### Q1 Philosophy

**"Clickbait to the door, quality inside"** — but now with a gentler entry point.

New readers blame EXTERNAL factors first:

- Dating apps/algorithms
- The economy
- Their boss/ex/parents
- Modern life/social media

We create content that VALIDATES these struggles, THEN bridges to type-specific insights.
