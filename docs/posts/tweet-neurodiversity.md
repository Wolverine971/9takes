Proposed Thread Outline:
Tweet 1 (Hook): "Everyone's suddenly 'discovering' they're neurodivergent and it's getting ridiculous. TikTok turned brain differences into personality accessories. Time for some brutal truth. ðŸ§µ"
Tweet 2: "You're collecting diagnoses like Pokemon cards. 'I zone out = ADHD!' 'Social anxiety = autism!' 'I'm organized = OCD!' Stop it."
Tweet 3: "Here's what you don't want to hear: Most of you aren't neurodivergent. You're just human with normal personality variations."
Tweet 4: "The uncomfortable reality? You're desperately hunting for labels to explain why you feel different instead of doing the real work."
Tweet 5: "While you're busy hunting for neurodivergent labels, you're missing the real goldmine: understanding WHY you became who you are."
Tweet 6: "The Enneagram doesn't give you a neat diagnosis to hide behind. It forces you to confront your deepest fears and childhood wounds."
Tweet 7: "Challenge: Stop looking for external validation of your struggles. Start asking why you really procrastinate, people-please, or perfectionist."
Tweet 8: "Ask a real question on @9takesdotcom and see how different personality types respond. You'll gain more self-awareness than any TikTok diagnosis."
