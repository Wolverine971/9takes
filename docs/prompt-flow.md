dont say "there is such a thing as that"

Say what is more important is the idea of personality maxing.

I want you to go into 3 parts. The mistake, the reason it happens and how to fix it

Here is an example of this flow

The Mistake: Trying to raise too much money, too quickly.

(1 Sentence Opener) Did you know that 78% of early-stage startups fail to raise even a single round of funding?

(3 Sentence Explanation) It’s not because most founders have terrible ideas. And it’s also not because the startup founders themselves lack experience or credibility. The mistake, and the reason so many startups fail to attract capital, is because the founders try to raise too much money, too quickly.

(1 Sentence Conclusion) Which sets them up for failure.

(1 Sentence Transition) This mistake leads to the following negative outcomes (which is why you should avoid it):

(3-5 Negative Outcome Bullets)

Erodes Long-Term Trust: Building startups is a long-term game, and when you over-ask in the beginning you decrease the likelihood of investors wanting to bet on any of your future ideas too.

Damages Co-Founder Relationship: A lot of times, young founders will make outlandish promises to people in order to bring them on as co-founders and early believers. The problem is, if you can’t deliver on those expectations, your team is going to abandon you.

Destroys Your Equity: The more money you ask for, the more you better believe investors are going to want in exchange. As a general rule of thumb, most startups aim to give up anywhere from 15% - 25% per fundraising round. And if you try to raise too much in the beginning, you’re going to end up on the higher-end of things here—giving away a huge chunk of your company before it’s even off the ground.

The Reason This Happens:

(1 Sentence Opener) The reason this happens is because most twentysomethings overestimate their abilities.

(3 Sentence Explanation) This is true for most people in their 20s, but it’s especially true for young, driven achievers. They have no concept of risk because they haven’t yet been confronted with many of the realities of life (college is a shelter, and far from a reflection of the real world). And they think “ideas” are what get rewarded, not effort.

(1 Sentence Conclusion) And that couldn’t be further from the truth.

(1 Sentence Transition) Here are some even more specific reasons why entrepreneurs in college tend to have a bad habit of raising too much money, too quickly:

(3-5 “Reason” Bullets)

The News Only Celebrates The Unicorns: Mainstream media does a horrible job of educating young entrepreneurs on what the real startup world is like. Turn on CNBC, or read any business publication, and all you’ll hear is story after story about some guy in a dorm room becoming a billionaire overnight. What you won’t hear are the thousands and thousands of failure stories, putting into context just how rare these “home-run” outcomes really are.

Shark Tank Makes Startup Life Seem Like A Reality TV Show: Shark Tank is incredibly entertaining, but unfortunately it has educated a generation of entrepreneurs to believe that the name of the game when it comes to raising money is to be “clever.” That it’s all about having a great pitch. And really, the wittiness of your pitch has very little to do with it.

Instagram Sets Faulty Expectations Of What’s “Real”: But the worst thing for young entrepreneurs is to spend time scrolling on Instagram—where it seems everyone is becoming rich in their 20s except you. The problem? Most of this content is fake, and these creators aren’t nearly as wealthy as they make themselves out to be.

How To Fix It

(1 Sentence Opener) So, how do we avoid this mistake?

(3 Sentence Explanation) Well, it all comes down to knowing what your alternatives are. Because the easy answer would be to simply “not raise more than you need to.” But this advice is going to go through one ear and out the other if we don’t drill into some action steps.

(1 Sentence Conclusion) So, let’s get specific.

(1 Sentence Transition) Instead of asking for as much money as you can, here’s what you should do instead:

(3-5 Action Step Bullets)

Reverse-Engineer Costs To Build An MVP: Before you start fundraising, you should know exactly how much you actually “need” in order to build a Minimum Viable Product. If you don’t know how much you need, then that’s the root of your problem.

Pretend You Can Never Raise Again: Here’s a good mental exercise. Pretend this is the only round of fundraising you will ever be able to do for your company. How much money do you think you will need in order to get your company to a place where you can start being profitable? Again, if you don’t know how or when you plan on being profitable, that’s a big problem.

Start With Raising From Friends & Family: Once you’ve settled on a reasonable number of money you need to raise (probably less than $250,000), don’t go straight for “the sharks.” Start with a friends and family round. Get a couple practice reps in pitching for your mom and dad. Besides, most institutional investors won’t be ready to give you money until your startup is further along anyways.

after you have completely gone into the problem go into the other parts for diving deeper and add more organization

explain the stoicism trap and talk about how it isnt proactive--> then talk about how personality maxing is about being proactive

that is why people are interested in personaltiy, they are trying to proactively understand themselves and others so they dont keep making the same mistakes or having the same fights or going down the same dark spirals.

and then talk about how the best tool for the job is the enneagram. Then we will go into an enneagram crash course
