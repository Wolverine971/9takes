_Created: 2025-12-03 (Pre-launch prep)_

_Purpose: Understand competitive landscape for key search queries_

## Executive Summary

**9takes Current Position:** Strong in mental health + Enneagram content (5.33% CTR on top page), but competitors are capturing traffic on relationship, ADHD, and self-sabotage content.

**Key Insight:** 9takes already RANKS for many key queries but loses clicks due to generic titles. Competitors with problem-focused, emotionally resonant titles win CTR even with inferior content.

**Opportunity:** 9takes has deeper psychological content than most competitors but doesn't communicate this in titles/metas.
