## Core Strategy Summary

### The Growth Formula
1. **Monday**: Engaging question (no link)
2. **Wednesday**: Value thread (no link)
3. **Thursday/Friday**: Follow-up with link

### Why This Works
- Questions get 3x engagement for small accounts
- No-link threads get 2x algorithm boost
- Delayed CTAs build trust first
- Every reply at 28 followers matters

### Daily Routine (15 min)
- **Morning (5 min)**: Reply to all comments
- **Lunch (5 min)**: Engage with 3 big accounts
- **Evening (5 min)**: Queue tomorrow's content

## Key Performance Indicators

### Week 1-2 Focus
- Reply rate: 10+ per thread
- Profile visits: 50+ per thread
- New followers: 5-10 per week

### Week 3-4 Focus
- Bookmark rate: 5%+
- Follow-back rate from replies: 30%
- New followers: 15-20 per week

## Content Themes by Week
1. **Week 1**: "Decode People Instantly" (First Impressions)
2. **Week 2**: "Your Hidden Patterns" (Self-Discovery)
3. **Week 3**: "Dating Decoded" (Relationships & Ghosting)

## Remember
At 28 followers, you're building a foundation. Every engaged follower who consistently interacts is worth 100 passive followers. Focus on building relationships, not just reach.
