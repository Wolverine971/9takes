## Week 1: "Decode People Instantly"
*Theme: First impressions and body language*
*Based on: first-impression-enneagram-playbook.md*

### Monday, Day 1 @ 9 AM - Question Hook
```
What's the weirdest thing you do in social situations that you think nobody notices?

I'll go first: I count how many times people check their phones during conversations.

(Spoiler: everyone has a pattern)
```

### Wednesday, Day 3 @ 12 PM - Main Thread
```
1/7 I've studied 1000+ social interactions and found something wild:

Everyone gives away their personality type in the first 30 seconds.

Here are 3 signs you're probably missing:

2/7 The Perfectionist Test:
Watch their eyes when you make a small mistake.

If they physically tense or their jaw clenches slightly - you've found a Type 1.

They can't help it. Imperfection causes them physical discomfort.

3/7 The Helper Test:
Mention any small problem.
"Traffic was awful" or "Coffee machine broke"

If they immediately offer solutions or help - Type 2.

They're not being nice. They're earning love through service.

4/7 The Achiever Test:
Count how long before they mention work or achievements.

Under 60 seconds? Type 3.

They're not bragging. They literally believe they ARE their accomplishments.

5/7 The Individualist Test:
Look for the one unique accessory or style choice.

If they physically recoil at small talk - Type 4.

They're not rude. Ordinary conversation feels like death to them.

6/7 The Investigator Test:
Notice who's in the corner observing.

Minimal eye contact + maximum awareness = Type 5.

They're not antisocial. They're conserving energy for what matters.

7/7 Once you see these patterns, every conversation becomes fascinating.

You stop taking things personally.
You understand what people actually need.
You connect instantly.

What patterns do you notice in people?

```
The responses to this are incredible.

Type 6s are asking "but how do we KNOW for sure?" ðŸ˜…

That's literally the most Type 6 response possible.

(Your skepticism is your superpower btw)
```

### Thursday, Day 4 @ 5 PM - Link Drop
```
That thread about reading people in 30 seconds?

100+ people DMed asking for the other types.

Here's all 9 with body language tells, fatal errors, and exact phrases that hook each type:

[link to first-impression-enneagram-playbook]

Reply with your type and I'll tell you your conversation superpower ðŸ‘‡
```

### Friday, Day 5 @ 9 AM - Community Engagement
```
From yesterday's replies, here's what I learned about you:

Type 1s: Y'all really do arrive 10 minutes early
Type 3s: Half of you replied while in meetings ðŸ˜‚
Type 7s: Your responses had 5 different topics
Type 9s: You're reading this but won't reply

Who feels seen? ðŸ‘€
```

## Week 2: "Your Hidden Patterns" 
*Theme: Self-sabotage in relationships*
*Based on: how-to-navigate-early-relationship-stages.md*

### Monday, Day 8 @ 9 AM - Poll
```
What ruins relationships fastest?

ðŸ”¸ Being too clingy (Type 2)
ðŸ”¸ Being too distant (Type 5)
ðŸ”¸ Being too critical (Type 1)
ðŸ”¸ Being too nice (Type 9)

Your answer reveals your type btw ðŸ‘‡
```

### Wednesday, Day 10 @ 8 AM - Story Thread
```
1/8 My friend kept dating the same toxic person in different bodies.

6 relationships. Same ending. Every time.

Then she discovered her Type 2 pattern:

2/8 The pattern:
- Give everything immediately
- Ignore her own needs  
- Build resentment silently
- Explode "out of nowhere"
- Partner leaves confused

Every. Single. Time.

3/8 Type 2s believe they earn love through giving.
So they give until empty.
Then blame others for not reciprocating.

But they never asked for anything.

The tragedy? They trained people to take.

4/8 Here's what every type does:

Type 1: Criticizes partner into leaving
Type 3: Performs instead of connecting
Type 4: Rejects before being rejected
Type 5: Withdraws until they're alone

5/8 Type 6: Tests until trust breaks
Type 7: Runs from depth into loneliness  
Type 8: Controls until no one's vulnerable
Type 9: Disappears until forgotten

Same wound. Different weapon.

6/8 The fix wasn't dating "better people."

It was recognizing the pattern.
Setting boundaries.
Asking for needs to be met.

Revolutionary for a Type 2.

7/8 My friend?

She's engaged now.
To someone who sees her patterns.
Who calls them out gently.
Who loves her beyond her usefulness.

First healthy relationship at 34.

8/8 We all have a sabotage pattern.

The question isn't IF you have one.
It's whether you'll see it before it costs you another relationship.

What pattern are you ready to break?
```

**1 hour later - Reply:**
```
The DMs from this thread... ðŸ’”

"I'm 47 and just realized I'm Type 9"
"This explains my three divorces"
"Currently doing this pattern RIGHT NOW"

Your awareness is the first step to breaking it.
```

### Thursday, Day 11 @ 12 PM - Vulnerable Share
```
Personal confession:

As a Type [X], I sabotaged my best relationship by [specific pattern].

Took me 2 years of therapy to see it.
Cost me someone I loved.

Now I catch myself before the pattern starts.

Growth isn't about being perfect.
It's about conscious imperfection.
```

### Friday, Day 12 @ 5 PM - Link + Value
```
This week we talked about relationship patterns.

The uncomfortable truth?
We're all running on autopilot until we see the pattern.

Here's how each type sabotages love (and how to stop):

Which pattern hit too close to home?

## Week 3: "Dating Decoded"
*Theme: Ghosting and FAQs*
*Based on: enneagram-types-being-ghosted.md & enneagram-faqs.md*

### Monday, Day 15 @ 12 PM - Controversial Hook
```
Hot take: 

The Enneagram is just astrology for people with masters degrees.

Except... Google uses it.
Your therapist probably uses it.
And it's scary accurate about your flaws.

What's your biggest skepticism about personality typing?
```

### Wednesday, Day 17 @ 9 AM - Ghosting Thread
```
1/6 Getting ghosted hits different based on your personality type.

Same experience. Different wound.

Here's what each type tells themselves:

2/6 Type 1: "I wasn't perfect enough"
Type 2: "I didn't give enough"
Type 3: "I wasn't impressive enough"
Type 4: "I'm too much"
Type 5: "I revealed too much"

3/6 Type 6: "I knew I couldn't trust them"
Type 7: "On to the next"
Type 8: "Their loss, weakness"
Type 9: "I probably deserved it"

Same ghosting. Nine different stories.

4/6 The Type 2 spiral is heartbreaking:

"Maybe their phone died"
"Are they hurt?"  
"Should I check in?"
"What did I do wrong?"
"How can I fix this?"

Creating excuses for someone who chose to disappear.

5/6 The truth about ghosting:

It's about THEIR inability to have difficult conversations.
Not your worth.
Not your lovability.
Not your enough-ness.

Their emotional cowardice isn't your deficiency.

6/6 Your type determines your ghosting wound.
But healing is the same:

Their behavior is information about them.
Not a verdict about you.

How did your last ghosting hit you?

```
Update: This thread has been shared 200+ times

My DMs are full of:
"This explains why it hurt so much"
"I'm sending this to my ex"
"Finally understand my reaction"

Sometimes naming the wound starts the healing.
```

### Thursday, Day 18 @ 2 PM - FAQ Bomb
```
Is the Enneagram real?

No peer-reviewed studies.
Limited scientific validation.
Murky origins.

Also:
Used at Google, Adobe, Slack
40+ years in therapy
Consistently reveals patterns

Not science. Pattern recognition.
Use the tool or don't.

But it works.
```

### Friday, Day 19 @ 10 AM - Week Recap + Link
```
This week's uncomfortable truths:

âœ“ Your personality type shapes your wounds
âœ“ Ghosting hurts differently for each type
âœ“ The Enneagram isn't scientific (but works)
âœ“ We're all skeptics until we see our patterns

What truth hit hardest?
```

### Saturday, Day 20 @ 11 AM - Community Building
```
Small account confession:

I have 28 followers.
But y'all engage like 10k.

Every reply matters.
Every share helps.
Every new follower is noticed.

Building something real > going viral.

Who else is building from scratch? ðŸ‘‡
