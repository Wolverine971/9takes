## Visual Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks for Readability
```
❌ BAD: Long paragraphs that run together making it hard to read on mobile devices where most people consume content

✅ GOOD:
Long paragraphs that run together.

Making it hard to read on mobile.

Where most people consume content.
```

### Emphasis Techniques
```
**ALL CAPS for major points**
THE PATTERN THAT RUINS EVERYTHING

*Italics for internal thoughts*
*What if I'm not enough?*

"Quotes for dialogue or key phrases"
She said: "I give up"

→ Arrows for progression
Fear → Behavior → Result

• Bullets for lists
• Clean
• Scannable  
• Organized
```

### Number Formats
```
Statistics:
87% of Type 2s do this
3 out of 4 Type 8s agree
10,000+ hours of observation

Lists:
1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point

Or:

→ First point
→ Second point
→ Third point
```

### Story with Visual Rhythm
```
1/ She ghosted me after 3 dates.

Perfect dates.
Great chemistry.
Then... nothing.

2/ I spent weeks analyzing:

What did I say?
What did I do?
What's wrong with me?

3/ Then I learned about Type 4 patterns.

The fear: Being ordinary
The wound: Not being seen
The defense: Reject first

4/ She didn't ghost because of me.

She ghosted because intimacy meant being seen.
And being seen meant possibly being ordinary.
And ordinary meant death to a Type 4.

5/ Now I understand:

Ghosting = Their pattern
Not my worth

Their wound
Not my failure

6/ Your type shapes how you leave.
And why it hurts.

But it's never really about you.

## Platform-Specific Formatting

### Twitter/X Limits
- 280 characters per tweet
- Threads up to 25 tweets (stick to 3-10)
- 4 images per tweet max
- 1 link per tweet recommended

### Readability Rules
1. **One idea per tweet** in threads
2. **Break at natural pauses** for flow
3. **Use line breaks** every 2-3 lines
4. **Start tweets with numbers** (2/, 3/, etc)
5. **End strong** - each tweet should stand alone

### Algorithm Optimization
- No links in Tweet 1 (kills reach)
- Ask questions (3x more engagement)
- Use native features (polls, etc)
- Reply to yourself to boost
- Quote tweet yourself next day
