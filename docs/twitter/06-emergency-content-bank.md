### Controversial Takes
```
Hot take:

Your Enneagram type is why you're still single.

Not your looks.
Not your luck.
Your unconscious pattern.

What pattern are you running?
```

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most people are mistyped.

They picked the type they WANT to be.
Not the type they ARE.

The right type makes you uncomfortable.
```

```
Spicy truth:

The Enneagram is just astrology for people with therapy money.

Except it actually works.

@ me.
```

---

### Personal Confessions
```
Type [X] confession:

I've ruined every relationship the same way.

[Specific pattern]

Seeing the pattern doesn't make it easier to break.
But at least now I know what I'm fighting.

Anyone else?
```

```
My toxic Type [X] trait:

[Specific behavior]

I know it's unhealthy.
I do it anyway.
Working on it in therapy.

Growth isn't linear, friends.
```

---

### Question Starters
```
Real question:

If you could change your Enneagram type, would you?

And which would you choose?

(I'd stay Type [X] but steal Type [Y]'s confidence)
```

```
For science:

What's your type and your biggest relationship dealbreaker?

Hypothesis: It's related to your core fear.
```

```
Survey time:

What type do you attract romantically?
What type do you WISH you attracted?

The pattern will shock you.
```

---

```
1/ Every type has a superpower nobody talks about:
```

```
1/ The sentence that breaks each type:
```

```
1/ What your type does at 3am when they can't sleep:
```

```
1/ Each type's love language (that they won't admit):

I'll go first: [behavior]
```

---

### Wisdom Drops
```
The Enneagram isn't about changing who you are.

It's about seeing who you've been.

So you can choose who you become.
```

```
Your type is your curriculum.
Not your conclusion.

The lesson you're here to learn.
Not the limit of who you can be.
```

```
We don't have personality types.

Personality types have us.

Until we see them.
```
