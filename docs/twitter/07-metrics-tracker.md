## Remember

Metrics tell a story, not the whole truth.

Focus on:
1. **Trend** over absolute numbers
2. **Engagement** over impressions
3. **Community** over followers
4. **Quality** over quantity

The goal isn't viral tweets.
It's building an engaged audience that trusts your voice.

Track progress, not perfection.
