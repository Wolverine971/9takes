## How to Create New 9 Takes Content

### Step 1: Pick a Universal Experience

- Something EVERYONE has felt
- Preferably slightly uncomfortable (more relatable)
- Examples: first date, job interview, criticism, cancelled plans, text silence

### Step 2: Write Each Type's Internal Monologue

- Type 1: Criticism/perfection lens
- Type 2: "Am I needed/loved?" lens
- Type 3: Achievement/image lens
- Type 4: Uniqueness/depth lens
- Type 5: Energy/knowledge lens
- Type 6: Security/trust lens
- Type 7: Pain avoidance/options lens
- Type 8: Control/respect lens
- Type 9: Peace/harmony lens

### Step 3: Make It Specific

- Don't say "Type 3 is stressed" → Say "Type 3 is already emailing from the car"
- The detail is where the recognition lives
- If it doesn't feel like espionage, add more specificity

### Step 4: End with Hook

- "Which reaction was yours?"
- "Same [situation]. 9 spirals."
- "Drop your type 👇"
