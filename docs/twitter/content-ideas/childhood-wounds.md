# Childhood Wounds Content

**Pillar:** Childhood Wounds (15%)
**Voice:** The sentence you heard as a child that still controls you. Attack the wound, validate the person. You're not broken—you're running protection software.

**Why this works:** "Inner child" and "reparenting" content is exploding on social media. TikTok hashtags like #innerchildhealing have billions of views. The Enneagram nails childhood wounds better than almost any system—this is your competitive edge.

---

## The Core Formula

```
The sentence you heard as a child that still controls you:

[Type X]: "[Specific childhood message]"

It's not a character flaw. It's protection software that's been running for [X] years.

The first step to uninstalling it? Recognizing you didn't write the code.
```

## Single Tweets (Gut Punches)

### The Childhood Message Thread

```
The sentence you heard as a child that still controls you:

Type 1: "We love you, but can you do it correctly?"
Type 2: "I don't need anything from you, go play."
Type 3: "Wow, look at [sibling] go!"
Type 4: "Why can't you just be normal?"
Type 5: "You're so sensitive. Toughen up."
Type 6: "You can't trust anyone but family."
Type 7: "Stop crying. Look on the bright side."
Type 8: "You have to be strong or they'll eat you alive."
Type 9: "Don't make waves. Keep the peace."

If one of these just punched you in the chest, I'm sorry.

But now you know where it came from.
```

### Type-Specific Wound Posts

```
Type 2s weren't born people-pleasers.

They learned that their needs made them unlovable.

So they became indispensable instead.

"If I give enough, they can't leave."

That's not generosity. That's a survival strategy from childhood.

And it's exhausting you.
```

```
Type 8s didn't choose to be intimidating.

They learned that vulnerability gets you hurt.

Someone used their softness against them.

So they armored up.

"I'll hurt you before you hurt me."

That's not aggression. That's a child still protecting themselves.
```

```
Type 4s don't romanticize pain for attention.

They learned that being "normal" meant being invisible.

The wound was the only thing that felt uniquely theirs.

"At least my suffering proves I exist."

That's not drama. That's a child who was never seen.
```

```
Type 9s aren't naturally agreeable.

They learned that having opinions caused conflict.
And conflict meant losing love.

So they erased themselves to keep the peace.

"I don't mind" = "I can't afford to want things."

That's not flexibility. That's disappearing to survive.
```

```
Type 6s don't overthink by choice.

They learned the world was unpredictable.
That trust gets punished.
That you have to see the danger coming.

"If I worry enough, I can prevent disaster."

That's not anxiety. That's hypervigilance from when safety wasn't guaranteed.
```

```
Type 1s aren't naturally critical.

They learned that mistakes had consequences.
That "good enough" wasn't safe.
That they had to be perfect to be loved.

"If I'm correct, I'm protected."

That courtroom in your head? It was installed in childhood.
```

```
Type 3s don't perform for fun.

They learned their worth was tied to achievement.
That who they were mattered less than what they did.

"What did you accomplish?" replaced "How do you feel?"

That's not ambition. That's a child who learned love was conditional on results.
```

```
Type 5s didn't choose isolation.

They learned that people drain, demand, and disappoint.
That their inner world was the only safe space.

"If I need nothing, no one can fail me."

That's not introversion. That's a child who withdrew to survive.
```

```
Type 7s aren't commitment-phobic.

They learned that staying still meant feeling pain.
That depth was dangerous.
That if you keep moving, nothing can catch you.

"Happiness is out there—not in here."

That's not optimism. That's avoidance with a smile.
```

### Inner Child Recognition

```
Your inner child isn't metaphorical.

It's the part of you that still:

- Flinches when someone raises their voice
- Freezes when asked "what do you need?"
- Overexplains to avoid being wrong
- Gives compulsively to avoid rejection
- Performs instead of existing

Different types, different flinches.

Same kid, still running the show.
```

```
Signs your inner child is driving:

Type 1: Harsh self-criticism over small mistakes
Type 2: Giving until empty, then resenting everyone
Type 3: Panic when you're not "winning"
Type 4: Feeling fundamentally broken
Type 5: Withdrawing when overwhelmed
Type 6: Catastrophizing every decision
Type 7: Running from silence
Type 8: Attacking before you can be hurt
Type 9: Going numb to avoid conflict

Which one shows up most?
```

### Reparenting by Type

```
What your inner child actually needs to hear:

Type 1: "You're allowed to make mistakes."
Type 2: "Your needs matter too."
Type 3: "You're loved for who you are, not what you do."
Type 4: "You're not too much. You're not too little."
Type 5: "You have enough. You are enough."
Type 6: "You can trust yourself."
Type 7: "It's safe to feel this."
Type 8: "It's safe to be soft."
Type 9: "Your voice matters."

The sentence your parents couldn't give you.

Can you give it to yourself?
```

```
Reparenting yourself isn't about blaming your parents.

It's about recognizing:

They gave you what they had.
It wasn't always what you needed.
You can give yourself what's missing now.

Type 1: Permission to be imperfect
Type 2: Permission to receive
Type 3: Permission to rest
Type 4: Permission to be ordinary AND special
Type 5: Permission to need people
Type 6: Permission to trust yourself
Type 7: Permission to feel pain
Type 8: Permission to be vulnerable
Type 9: Permission to take up space

Which one are you practicing?
```

## Threads

### Thread 1: Why Generic Self-Help Fails You

```
1/8
"Just love yourself" doesn't work.

Because the wound that taught you NOT to love yourself is different for each type.

Generic advice ignores WHY you're stuck.

Here's the real problem—and the real fix: 🧵

2/8
Type 1: "Just accept yourself"

But your inner child learned acceptance = danger.
Mistakes had consequences.
Imperfection meant disapproval.

You can't "just accept" when a judge lives in your head.

First step: Acknowledge the judge isn't protecting you anymore.

3/8
Type 2: "Just set boundaries"

But your inner child learned boundaries = abandonment.
Having needs meant being left.
So you became needless.

You can't set boundaries when you don't believe you deserve them.

First step: Practice wanting ONE thing for yourself.

4/8
Type 3: "Just be authentic"

But your inner child learned authenticity = rejection.
You were loved for achievements, not existence.
So you became a performance.

You can't be authentic when you don't know who you are without the wins.

First step: Sit with "nothing" for 10 minutes.

5/8
Type 4: "Just focus on the positive"

But your inner child learned that pain = identity.
Being "fine" meant being invisible.
The wound was proof you exist.

You can't think positive when ordinary feels like death.

First step: Find ONE ordinary thing that brings real joy.

6/8
Type 5: "Just open up to people"

But your inner child learned openness = depletion.
People took more than they gave.
Withdrawal was the only protection.

You can't open up when closeness feels like an invasion.

First step: Share ONE small thing. See what happens.

7/8
Type 6: "Just stop worrying"

But your inner child learned relaxing = danger.
The one time you didn't prepare, something went wrong.
Vigilance kept you safe.

You can't stop worrying when your nervous system thinks it's keeping you alive.

First step: Let ONE small thing go unprepared. Survive it.

8/8
Types 7-9:

7: "Just slow down" → Pain caught up when you stopped
8: "Just soften" → Softness got you hurt
9: "Just speak up" → Speaking up caused conflict

The advice isn't wrong. It's just incomplete without the WHY.

Your type's wound determines your path.

What's yours?
```

### Thread 2: How Childhood Shaped Your Enneagram Type

```
1/9
You weren't born broken.

You were born with a sensitivity.
Life confirmed it.
You adapted.

Here's how childhood shaped each type: 🧵

2/9
Type 1: The Perfectionist Wound

You were sensitive to criticism.
Someone (parent, teacher, environment) confirmed that mistakes = bad.
You adapted by becoming your own harshest critic.

The courtroom in your head? It's not protecting you. It's prosecuting you.

3/9
Type 2: The Worthlessness Wound

You were sensitive to rejection.
Someone confirmed that your needs were inconvenient.
You adapted by becoming indispensable.

"If I'm needed, I'm safe." But you forgot you're allowed to need things too.

4/9
Type 3: The Worthless-Without-Achievement Wound

You were sensitive to being overlooked.
Someone confirmed that love came through doing, not being.
You adapted by achieving constantly.

You're not a human doing. You're allowed to just... be.

5/9
Type 4: The Abandonment/Deficiency Wound

You were sensitive to feeling different.
Someone (or life) confirmed you didn't fit.
You adapted by making your uniqueness your identity.

But "special" and "broken" got tangled up. You can untangle them.

6/9
Type 5: The Intrusion/Scarcity Wound

You were sensitive to overwhelm.
Someone confirmed that people drain and disappoint.
You adapted by withdrawing into your mind.

Your inner world isn't a fortress. It's become a prison. The door opens from inside.

7/9
Type 6: The Trust/Safety Wound

You were sensitive to uncertainty.
Someone (or life) confirmed the world was unpredictable.
You adapted by preparing for everything.

But the hypervigilance isn't protection anymore. It's exhaustion.

8/9
Type 7: The Deprivation/Pain Wound

You were sensitive to pain.
Someone (or life) confirmed that staying still hurt.
You adapted by constantly moving toward pleasure.

The escape route worked then. But you're running from feelings that need to be felt.

9/9
Types 8 & 9:

Type 8: Sensitive to vulnerability. Adapted with armor.
Type 9: Sensitive to conflict. Adapted by disappearing.

Both strategies made sense then.

Neither are serving you now.

What would it look like to update the software?
```

## Engagement Responses

### When someone shares their wound:

```
That's a [Type X] wound doing what it does.

[Specific validation of the pattern]

It made sense when you were [young]. It's just not serving you anymore.

What does your inner child need to hear right now?
```

### When someone asks about healing:

```
Healing isn't about forgetting the wound.

It's about:
1. Recognizing when the old pattern is running
2. Understanding WHY it started (protection, not flaw)
3. Giving yourself what was missing

For [Type X], that's usually: [specific unmet need]

What resonates?
```

### When someone shares family trauma:

```
Intergenerational patterns are brutal.

Your parents' wounds became your normal.
Their type shaped how they parented.
Which triggered your type's core fear.

You're not continuing the cycle by understanding it. You're interrupting it.
```
