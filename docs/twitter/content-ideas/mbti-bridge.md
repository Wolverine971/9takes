# MBTI Bridge Content

**Pillar:** MBTI Bridge (20%)
**Voice:** MBTI is the costume. Enneagram is the wound underneath. Translate, don't hate.

**Strategy:** Quote-tweet viral MBTI posts and add the Enneagram layer. Their audience becomes your audience.

## The Core Formula

```
[MBTI type] is a costume.

[What they're ACTUALLY doing through Enneagram lens — brutal]

[The wound underneath]

MBTI tells you what you do. Enneagram tells you why you can't stop.
```

## Single Tweets (Quote-Tweet Ready)

### INTJ Translations

```
INTJ is a costume.

Half of you are Type 5s avoiding people because human interaction drains your life force.

Half are Type 1s who think being right = being good.

MBTI tells you you're "strategic." Enneagram tells you you're afraid of being incompetent. Or corrupt.

Different fears. Same cold exterior.
```

```
"INTJs are strategic masterminds"

Translation: You're a Type 5 who read so many books you forgot how to have a conversation.

Or you're a Type 1 who thinks being correct is a personality.

Either way, the Wikipedia deep-dives aren't replacing human connection.
```

```
INTJ "death stare" is just:

Type 5: "You're using my energy and I didn't consent"
Type 1: "You're wrong and I'm too tired to explain why"

The intimidation isn't intentional. It's exhaustion.
```

### INFP Translations

```
Every INFP thinks they're a Type 4.

Half of you are Type 9s who just want to be left alone with your feelings.

The difference?

Type 4: "Nobody understands my unique pain"
Type 9: "I don't want to be a problem"

Both feel misunderstood. Different reasons.
```

```
INFP "authenticity" is either:

Type 4: "I must express my unique essence or I'll die"
Type 9: "I literally don't know what I want, I just know it's not THIS"

One drowns in identity. The other forgot they had one.

Which flavor of lost are you?
```

```
"INFPs are gentle dreamers"

Type 4 INFP: Dreams of being recognized for their special suffering
Type 9 INFP: Dreams of everyone leaving them alone

The dreaming is the same. The wound is completely different.
```

### ENFP Translations

```
ENFP energy is just Type 7 running from feelings at the speed of enthusiasm.

47 interests.
12 unfinished projects.
Constant brainstorming to avoid the one thing they're actually avoiding.

That's not "Ne-dom." That's avoidance with charisma.
```

```
"ENFPs can't commit"

Type 7 ENFP: Commitment means missing other options (FOMO as lifestyle)
Type 4 ENFP: Commitment means being ordinary (identity death)

Both look flaky. Different terror underneath.
```

### INFJ Translations

```
INFJs being "rare" is just Type 4s who needed a framework to prove they're special.

Or Type 1s who needed a moral framework for their perfectionism.

Or Type 2s who needed proof their people-reading is a gift, not a trauma response.

The rarity isn't the point. The validation is.
```

```
"INFJ door slam"

Type 1 INFJ: You violated their moral code (unforgivable)
Type 4 INFJ: You failed to see their depth (unforgivable)
Type 2 INFJ: You took without giving back (finally snapped)

Same door. Different lock.
```

```
INFJ "absorbing other people's emotions" is just:

Type 2: Can't tell where they end and you begin (boundary wound)
Type 4: Needs your emotions to feel connected to humanity
Type 9: Merged so deeply they forgot their own feelings exist

Empathy or enmeshment? The line is blurry.
```

### ENTJ Translations

```
ENTJ "natural leadership" is:

Type 8: Control or be controlled (trust issues in a power suit)
Type 3: Must be seen winning (worth = achievement)

Both climb. Different reasons.

8s climb because the alternative is vulnerability.
3s climb because the alternative is worthlessness.
```

```
"ENTJs are intimidating"

Type 8 ENTJ: "I'll hurt you before you hurt me" (armor)
Type 3 ENTJ: "I need you to see me winning" (performance)

The intimidation is real. The invincibility is a lie.
```

### INTP Translations

```
INTP "logical" is just Type 5 hoarding knowledge to feel safe.

"I need more information before I can act."
Translation: Acting means risking being wrong. Knowledge feels safer.

You're not thinking. You're avoiding.
```

```
"INTPs struggle with emotions"

Type 5: Emotions are data I don't have enough resources to process
Type 9: Emotions are inconvenient disruptions to my peace

Both look detached. One is protecting energy. One is avoiding conflict.
```

### ENFJ Translations

```
ENFJ "natural caretaker" is just Type 2 with better social skills.

Reading the room so hard you forget you're in it.
Giving until you're empty.
Wondering why no one takes care of YOU.

That's not Fe-dom. That's codependency with a charisma upgrade.
```

```
"ENFJs are manipulative"

Harsh. But also:

Type 2 ENFJ: Manipulates through giving (so you owe them)
Type 3 ENFJ: Manipulates through charm (so you admire them)

Both want love. Both forgot how to ask directly.
```

### ISTP Translations

```
ISTP "independent" is:

Type 5: People drain me, machines don't judge
Type 9: Going along is easier than explaining what I actually want
Type 8: Relying on people means they can hurt you

Three paths to the same garage.
```

### ESFP Translations

```
ESFP "life of the party" is often Type 7 running from pain so fast it looks like dancing.

The fun isn't fake. But the exhaustion from maintaining it is real.

When the party ends, what are you avoiding going home to?
```

## Threads

### Thread 1: Your MBTI Is Your Costume

```
1/8
Your MBTI type tells you what you do.

Your Enneagram type tells you why you can't stop.

One is the costume. One is the wound.

Here's the translation: 🧵

2/8
INTJ → Usually Type 5 or Type 1

Type 5 INTJ: Avoids people to protect energy
Type 1 INTJ: Avoids people because they're wrong

Same cold exterior. Different core fear.

5s fear being useless. 1s fear being corrupt.

3/8
INFP → Usually Type 4 or Type 9

Type 4 INFP: "Nobody understands my depth"
Type 9 INFP: "I don't want to be a burden"

4s fear having no identity. 9s fear having too much.

4/8
ENFP → Usually Type 7 or Type 4

Type 7 ENFP: Enthusiasm as escape from pain
Type 4 ENFP: Enthusiasm as proof of uniqueness

Both sparkle. Different fuel sources.

7s run FROM. 4s run TOWARD (intensity).

5/8
INFJ → Usually Type 4, Type 1, or Type 2

Type 4 INFJ: The rarity proves they're special
Type 1 INFJ: The rarity proves they're right
Type 2 INFJ: The rarity proves they're needed

Which one are you wearing?

### Thread 2: Why MBTI Mistyping Happens

```
1/6
90% of MBTI mistypes happen because people pick the type they WANT to be.

The Enneagram explains why: 🧵

2/6
Type 3s mistype as whatever MBTI sounds most impressive.

INTJ = "strategic genius"
ENTJ = "born leader"
ENTP = "visionary innovator"

They're not lying. They're performing. Even on personality tests.

3/6
Type 4s mistype as the rarest MBTI.

INFJ = "less than 1% of the population"

If everyone's an INFJ, no one is.

The uniqueness addiction doesn't care about accuracy.

4/6
Type 9s mistype as whoever they were around when they took the test.

Took it with an ENFP friend? Suddenly an ENFP.
Took it at work? Suddenly an ISTJ.

They're not mistypes. They're merges.

5/6
Type 6s take the test 47 times and get 47 different results.

"But which one am I REALLY?"

The anxiety about getting it wrong IS the answer.

6/6
MBTI tells you the costume.
Enneagram tells you why you picked it.

What type do you WISH you were?

That's the real question.
```

## Engagement Responses

### When someone shares MBTI type:

```
[MBTI] is the what.

But are you a Type [X] or Type [Y]?

[X] does that because [core fear].
[Y] does that because [different core fear].

Same behavior. Different wound. Which one hit harder?
```

### When someone defends MBTI:

```
MBTI isn't wrong. It's incomplete.

It tells you the pattern. Not the pain driving it.

Two INTJs can look identical. One's a 5 hoarding energy. One's a 1 hoarding correctness.

The behavior matches. The healing path doesn't.
```

### When someone asks about differences:

```
MBTI = How your brain processes information
Enneagram = Why you're terrified of [core fear]

One is cognitive. One is emotional.

You need both. MBTI tells you how you think. Enneagram tells you what you're running from.
```

**Costume/Mask:**

- Greek statue removing MBTI mask to reveal Enneagram number underneath
- Greek statue with MBTI letters dissolving into Enneagram symbol

**Translation Visual:**

- Split image: surface MBTI behavior on top, wound underneath
- Greek statue with visible internal structure (MBTI external, Enneagram internal)

**Comparison:**

- Two identical Greek statues labeled same MBTI, different Enneagram numbers showing different internal postures
