## Single Tweets (Gut Punches)

### ADHD by Type

```
ADHD hits different based on your type:

Type 1 + ADHD: "Why can't I just DO the thing I know is right?"
Type 3 + ADHD: "I have 47 productivity systems and use none"
Type 4 + ADHD: "My brain is too unique for neurotypical structures"
Type 5 + ADHD: "I hyperfocused for 12 hours on the wrong thing"
Type 6 + ADHD: "What if the medication has side effects I can't predict?"

Same diagnosis. Different flavor of chaos.
```

```
Type 7 + ADHD is a cheat code for avoiding pain.

47 browser tabs.
3 unfinished projects.
Constantly planning the next thing instead of finishing this thing.

You call it "ADHD."
Your therapist calls it "elaborate avoidance."

Both can be true. The question is which one you're using as an excuse.
```

```
Type 1 + ADHD is the cruelest combination.

Internal standards: Perfectionism
Brain capacity: Chaos goblin

Every dropped ball feels like moral failure.
Every unfinished task is proof you're fundamentally flawed.

It's not executive dysfunction. It's executive dysfunction + a courtroom in your head that never adjourns.

The verdict is always guilty.
```

```
ADHD + Type 5:

Hyperfocuses for 14 hours on a niche interest.
Forgets to eat.
Forgets to respond to humans.
Becomes world expert on something irrelevant.
Still can't do the taxes.

"But I learned so much!"

You hoarded information instead of functioning. That's not productivity. That's avoidance with extra steps.
```

### Anxiety by Type

```
Type 6 anxiety vs regular anxiety:

Regular: "What if something goes wrong?"
Type 6: "I've already imagined 47 ways it could go wrong and prepared for 43 of them"

You're not anxious. You're running a full-time contingency planning department in your brain.

The preparation doesn't reduce anxiety. It feeds it.
```

```
Type 1 anxiety sounds like: "I'm doing everything wrong"
Type 2 anxiety sounds like: "Everyone needs something from me"
Type 3 anxiety sounds like: "I'm falling behind everyone"
Type 4 anxiety sounds like: "Nobody will ever understand me"
Type 5 anxiety sounds like: "I don't have enough energy for this"
Type 6 anxiety sounds like: "Everything is about to go wrong"

Same nervous system. Different soundtrack.
```

```
Type 3 anxiety:

Panic attack in the bathroom.
Fixed makeup.
Back to the meeting.
Nobody noticed.

That's not resilience. That's performance under duress.

The achievement keeps going even when you're breaking inside.

High-functioning doesn't mean okay. It means good at hiding.
```

### Autism + Masking

```
Autism masking by type:

Type 1: Over-prepares for every social situation, scripts conversations
Type 2: Focuses entirely on others to avoid being observed
Type 3: Performs neurotypical success until they can't anymore
Type 4: Reframes autism as "artistic temperament"
Type 5: Withdraws to avoid masking demands entirely

The mask isn't protection. It's a prison with a smile painted on.
```

```
Type 9 + autism:

"I'm fine with whatever"
(Translation: I can't process my own preferences over the noise)

"I don't mind"
(Translation: Making a choice takes energy I don't have)

"Whatever you want"
(Translation: I've already lost myself in trying to accommodate everyone)

The agreeableness isn't peace. It's camouflage. And it's exhausting.
```

### Depression by Type

```
Depression lies differently to each type:

Type 1: "You're a failure who can't meet even basic standards"
Type 2: "Nobody actually needs you—they just use you"
Type 3: "Your achievements mean nothing and neither do you"
Type 4: "You're fundamentally broken in ways others aren't"
Type 5: "You have nothing valuable to offer anyone"
Type 6: "Everyone will eventually abandon you"
Type 7: "You'll never escape this feeling no matter where you run"
Type 8: "You're weak and everyone can see it"
Type 9: "You don't matter enough for anyone to notice you're gone"

Depression is fluent in every type's core fear.

Which lie does it tell you?
```

```
Type 4 depression:

"At least my suffering is mine."

Romanticizing the darkness because it's familiar.
Afraid of healing because ordinariness feels like death.
Collecting sad songs like evidence of depth.

That's not authenticity. That's staying sick because wellness feels boring.

You can keep your depth AND feel okay. That's not selling out. That's growing up.
```

## Threads

### Thread 1: ADHD + Your Type

```
1/8
ADHD isn't one thing.

Your Enneagram type shapes how ADHD shows up, what it ruins, and what might actually help.

Same brain. Different patterns. 🧵

2/8
Type 1 + ADHD: The Perfectionist Paradox

Executive dysfunction + perfectionism = paralysis.

You can't start until you can do it perfectly.
You can't focus long enough to do it perfectly.
So you don't start.

The shame spiral isn't ADHD. It's your inner critic using ADHD as evidence.

3/8
Type 2 + ADHD: The Helper Who Forgot Themselves

Hyperfocuses on: Other people's problems
Forgets: Own needs, deadlines, self-care

"I'll handle my stuff after I help everyone else."

You won't. And then you'll feel guilty about that too.

ADHD + caretaking = burnout speedrun.

4/8
Type 3 + ADHD: The Productivity Paradox

47 productivity systems researched.
Zero consistently used.
Buys planners like they're medication.

You're not lazy. You're performing productivity instead of doing it.

The shame of underperforming is worse than the ADHD itself.

5/8
Type 4 + ADHD: The Misunderstood Brain

"My brain is too unique for neurotypical strategies."
"I need to feel inspired to work."
"Structure kills my creativity."

Translation: You've aestheticized your executive dysfunction.

ADHD isn't your identity. But it's definitely your excuse.

6/8
Type 5 + ADHD: The Information Hoarder

Hyperfocuses on: Research rabbit holes
Avoids: Actually doing the thing with the knowledge

12 hours on a Wikipedia deep-dive.
Zero hours on the project due tomorrow.

The learning feels productive. It isn't.

7/8
Type 6 + ADHD: The Anxious Researcher

Researches every ADHD medication.
Worries about side effects.
Delays treatment.
Still struggling.

The preparation for action is replacing the action.

At some point you have to stop researching and start trying.

8/8
Types 7-9:

Type 7: Uses ADHD as excuse to chase shiny things
Type 8: Forces through ADHD with willpower (unsustainable)
Type 9: Uses ADHD to disappear (productive avoidance)

The pattern isn't the ADHD. It's your type's response to having ADHD.

What's yours?
```

### Thread 2: Why Mental Health Treatment Fails You

```
1/7
Mental health treatment fails when it ignores your personality.

Same diagnosis. Different type. Different approach needed.

Here's why therapy isn't working for you: 🧵

2/7
Type 1: Therapy feels like admitting failure

"I should be able to fix this myself."
"Needing help means I'm broken."

The perfectionism blocks the treatment that could help the perfectionism.

You need: Permission to be imperfect. A therapist who doesn't judge.

3/7
Type 2: Therapy feels selfish

"Others have it worse."
"I should be helping people, not getting help."

You give to everyone except yourself. Including your therapist.

You need: Permission to receive. Homework that focuses on YOU.

4/7
Type 3: Therapy threatens the performance

"What if people find out?"
"I can't afford to look weak."

You high-function through breakdowns.

You need: A therapist who sees past the success. Space where achievement doesn't matter.

5/7
Type 4: Therapy threatens the identity

"What if I'm boring without my pain?"
"Who am I if I'm not suffering?"

The wound feels more authentic than wellness.

You need: Permission to heal AND keep your depth. Proof that ordinary ≠ empty.

6/7
Type 5: Therapy feels invasive

"I don't want someone in my head."
"I should be able to understand this myself."

You research therapy more than you do therapy.

You need: A therapist who respects boundaries. Space to think between sessions.

7/7
Types 6-9:

Type 6: Worries therapy will make it worse
Type 7: Avoids therapy by staying "positive"
Type 8: Sees vulnerability as weakness
Type 9: Goes along with therapy but doesn't engage

Personality-informed treatment works better.

What's your type's therapy blocker?

## Engagement Responses

### When someone shares ADHD + type struggles:

```
ADHD + Type [X] is brutal.

You're dealing with [specific combination pattern].

That's not weakness. That's two things that feed each other in the worst ways.

What's helped? (Asking genuinely, not rhetorically.)
```

### When someone shares mental health struggle:

```
That's your type's wound doing what it does.

Type [X]s hear [specific depression/anxiety lie] louder than anyone.

It's lying to you. But I know it doesn't feel that way.

What do you need right now?
```

### When someone disagrees:

```
Fair pushback.

Neurodiversity + personality is complicated territory.

What's your experience? What's working for you?

The patterns are general. Your story is specific.
```
