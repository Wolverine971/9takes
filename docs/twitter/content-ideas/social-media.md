# Social Media Psychology Content

**Pillar:** Shadow Content (30%)
**Voice:** Your doom-scrolling is your wound in app form. Attack the pattern, reveal the addiction.

---

## Single Tweets (Gut Punches)

### Platform Addiction as Wound

```
Your favorite social media platform is your personality's coping mechanism:

Instagram: Type 3s performing success for strangers
Twitter: Type 8s looking for fights
Reddit: Type 5s hoarding information they'll never use
TikTok: Type 7s running from their emotions at 60fps
LinkedIn: Type 3s performing success for people they hate

The app isn't the addiction. The wound is.
```

```
Type 4s on Instagram:

Curating depression like it's an art gallery.
Posting sad lyrics like someone will finally understand.
Aesthetic melancholy as identity.

The feed isn't you. It's the version of you that needs to be seen suffering beautifully.

That's not authenticity. That's performance with a filter.
```

```
Type 5s don't doom-scroll.

They "research."

10,000 saved posts.
47 rabbit holes deep.
Zero human interaction.

It's not learning. It's hiding from the world while pretending to understand it.

The information hoarding isn't wisdom. It's a wall.
```

### Doom-Scrolling Patterns

```
Why you can't stop scrolling:

Type 1: Looking for something "worth" your time (nothing is)
Type 2: Checking if everyone's okay (they're not, and neither are you)
Type 3: Comparing yourself to highlight reels (losing)
Type 4: Finding content that matches your mood (spiral)
Type 5: Collecting information for "later" (never)
Type 6: Refreshing for news that confirms your fears (always)
Type 7: Anything to avoid the feeling you're running from
Type 8: Arguments to win
Type 9: Disappearing from your own life

The scroll isn't boredom. It's avoidance.
```

```
Type 7s and social media:

47 tabs open.
3 apps switching.
FOMO about missing something on the app you're not using.
While using an app.

You're not connected. You're distracted.

And distraction is just running from yourself with better WiFi.
```

```
Type 6s on Twitter:

Fact-checking everything.
Worried about misinformation.
Arguing with strangers about sources.
Still anxious.

The verification loop isn't making you safer. It's feeding the beast that says nothing is trustworthy.

Including yourself.
```

### Instagram vs Reality

```
Instagram vs Reality by type:

Type 1: Posts organization porn, reality is perfectionist paralysis
Type 2: Posts "blessed" family pics, reality is burnout from caring
Type 3: Posts achievements, reality is imposter syndrome spiral
Type 4: Posts moody aesthetics, reality is feeling ordinary and hating it
Type 5: Posts rarely, reality is rich inner world they can't share
Type 9: Posts peaceful moments, reality is internal conflict they're numbing

The gap between your grid and your life? That's the wound talking.
```

```
Type 3s delete posts that don't perform.

Not because they're embarrassed.
Because low engagement feels like being unloved.

Their worth fluctuates with their like count.

That's not social media addiction.
That's outsourcing your self-esteem to an algorithm.

And the algorithm doesn't love anyone.
```

### Reddit Behavior

```
Your Reddit personality is your wound with anonymity:

Type 1: Corrects strangers' grammar (the compulsion won't stop)
Type 2: Gives advice on r/relationships (living vicariously through helping)
Type 3: Humblebrags on r/careerguidance
Type 4: Deep in obscure subreddits because mainstream is death
Type 5: Lurks, saves, never engages (information vampirism)
Type 6: Fact-checks everything, trusts nothing
Type 7: Subscribed to 200 subs, reads none deeply
Type 8: Sorts by controversial for fun
Type 9: Upvotes everything, comments nothing (digital disappearing act)

Anonymous or not, the pattern follows.
```

```
Type 8s love Twitter because it's socially acceptable arguing.

Every hot take is a battle.
Every ratio is a win.
Every block is someone who couldn't handle them.

But winning arguments with strangers doesn't fill the void that needs to control everything.

The combativeness isn't strength. It's armor for the softness you can't show.
```

## Threads

### Thread 1: Your Social Media Addiction Is Your Wound

```
1/7
Your social media addiction isn't about social media.

It's about what you're using the app to avoid.

Here's what your scrolling is actually doing for you: 🧵

2/7
Type 1: Perfection Scrolling

Looking for the "right" content.
Curating feeds obsessively.
Fact-checking before sharing.

You're not consuming content. You're trying to control the chaos of the internet.

That's not engagement. That's compulsion with an algorithm.

3/7
Type 2: Validation Scrolling

Checking who liked your post.
Helping strangers in comments.
Living in everyone else's DMs.

You're not connecting. You're earning love from people who don't know you exist.

The likes aren't love. But your brain can't tell the difference.

4/7
Type 3: Comparison Scrolling

Measuring yourself against highlight reels.
Posting strategically for maximum reach.
Deleting anything that underperforms.

You're not sharing. You're performing for an audience that isn't watching.

Your worth isn't in your metrics. But try telling your nervous system that.

5/7
Type 4: Mood-Matching Scrolling

Curating content that matches your sadness.
Looking for proof others feel this way too.
Romanticizing the aesthetic of struggle.

You're not processing. You're marinating.

The algorithm feeds you more of what you feel. That's not understanding. That's a loop.

6/7
Type 5: Information Hoarding

10,000 saved posts you'll never read.
Rabbit holes that lead nowhere.
Research that replaces living.

You're not learning. You're hiding.

The knowledge doesn't count if you never use it. It's just an elaborate way to avoid the world.

7/7
The cure isn't deleting the app.

It's asking: "What am I using this to avoid?"

Type 6: Security. Type 7: Pain. Type 8: Vulnerability. Type 9: Conflict.

The scroll ends when you face the thing underneath.

What are you really scrolling from?
```

### Thread 2: Why You're Addicted to Your Phone

```
1/6
You're not addicted to your phone.

You're addicted to what your phone helps you avoid.

Your personality type determines the escape route: 🧵

2/6
The Distraction Types (7, 9, 3)

Type 7: Running from pain → phone = infinite new shiny things
Type 9: Running from conflict → phone = numbing disconnection
Type 3: Running from worthlessness → phone = constant validation hits

You use your phone to feel something other than what you feel.

3/6
The Control Types (1, 5, 6)

Type 1: Chaos is unbearable → phone = curated, controlled information
Type 5: People are exhausting → phone = connection without energy drain
Type 6: Uncertainty is threatening → phone = constant news/updates

You use your phone to manage anxiety that the phone is making worse.

4/6
The Connection Types (2, 4, 8)

Type 2: Need to be needed → phone = endless people to help
Type 4: Need to be understood → phone = communities that "get" you
Type 8: Need to dominate → phone = arguments to win

You use your phone to meet needs it can never actually meet.

5/6
The pattern:

Phone fulfills need → brain gets dopamine → problem still exists → need more phone → problem gets worse → need more phone

Your personality determines the flavor of addiction.
The addiction loop is the same for everyone.

6/6
The question isn't "how do I use my phone less?"

It's "what need am I trying to meet?"

And then: "Can my phone actually meet it?"

(Spoiler: It can't.)

What need are you using your phone to avoid facing directly?
```

## Engagement Responses

### When someone shares social media struggles:

```
That's textbook Type [X] digital pattern.

You're not addicted to the app. You're addicted to what it helps you avoid.

For [X]s, that's usually [core fear/avoidance].

What happens when you put the phone down and sit with that?
```

### When someone asks about digital detox:

```
Digital detox doesn't work if you don't replace what the phone was doing.

For Type [X], the phone is probably handling [specific need].

Delete the app, but the need follows you.

What's a non-phone way to meet that need?
```

## Image Concepts (Midjourney)

**Platform Addiction:**

- Greek statue scrolling phone while crumbling, blue light on face
- Greek statue with phone chains attached to wrists
- Nine Greek statues, each with different phone posture (doom-scrolling, arguing, performing)

**Digital Avoidance:**

- Greek statue surrounded by floating notification bubbles, overwhelmed expression
- Greek statue looking at phone while real life blurs behind them
