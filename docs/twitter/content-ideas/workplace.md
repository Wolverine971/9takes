# Workplace Patterns Content

**Pillar:** Shadow Content (30%) + Mental Health (25%)
**Voice:** Expose the workplace mask. Attack the pattern, reveal the wound.

## Single Tweets (Gut Punches)

### Procrastination

```
Your procrastination isn't laziness. It's your wound running the show.

Type 1: "If I can't do it perfectly, I won't start"
Type 2: "I'll help everyone else first, then I won't have time"
Type 4: "I'm not inspired enough to be creative"
Type 5: "I don't know enough yet"
Type 6: "What if I do it wrong?"

The task isn't the problem. Your core fear is.
```

```
Type 7 procrastination looks like "being busy."

47 tabs open.
Three projects started.
Zero finished.

It's not ADHD (maybe it is, but also:)

It's running from the thing that's actually boring.
Because boredom = confronting what you're avoiding.

The tabs are armor.
```

```
Type 3s don't procrastinate.

They "strategically delay."

Translation: They won't do it until they can do it impressively enough to post about.

If it can't be a LinkedIn humblebrag, it's not worth starting.

That's not ambition. That's performance anxiety in a suit.
```

### Meeting Behavior

```
Your meeting persona exposes everything:

Type 1: "Actually, the correct answer is..."
Type 2: "How can I help with that?"
Type 3: "What's the deliverable?"
Type 5: "I'll get back to you" (never gets back)
Type 6: "What could go wrong?"
Type 7: "What if we ALSO did—"
Type 8: "Let's cut the bullshit and decide"
Type 9: "I think everyone makes good points" (internally screaming)

Which mask are you wearing?
```

```
Type 9s in meetings:

Said: "I'm flexible, whatever works for everyone"
Meant: "I have strong opinions but sharing them feels like violence"

Said: "I'm fine either way"
Meant: "I'll agree now and resent you later"

Said: "Let's table this"
Meant: "I'm going to disappear until this conflict resolves itself"

Peace-keeping isn't peace. It's slow-motion explosion prep.
```

### Email Styles

```
Your email style is your wound on display:

Type 1: Proofreads 5x, sends at 11pm, includes corrections
Type 2: "Hope you're doing well!" + offers to help with things you didn't ask for
Type 3: Bullet points, strategic CC list, sent at 6am to show dedication
Type 5: One-word response, technically sufficient, emotionally absent
Type 8: Gets to the point, sounds angry, isn't (probably)

Your inbox is a crime scene of personality patterns.
```

```
Type 2 emails be like:

"Hi! Hope you're having a great day! 🌟

Just wanted to check in and see if you need ANYTHING at all!

Happy to help! No really! Anything!

P.S. Here's a resource I thought might help with the thing you mentioned three months ago that you probably forgot about!"

That's not helpfulness. That's trying to make yourself indispensable so you can't be abandoned.
```

### Career Self-Sabotage

```
How each type destroys their own career:

Type 1: Criticizes until no one wants to work with them
Type 2: Burns out doing everyone else's job
Type 3: Climbs the ladder, realizes it's against the wrong wall
Type 4: Quits before they can be fired (or recognized)
Type 5: Over-qualifies for jobs they're afraid to actually do
Type 6: Tests loyalty until employers fail them
Type 7: Chases every opportunity, masters none
Type 8: Burns bridges in the name of "authenticity"
Type 9: Merges with whatever role they're given, disappears

Your career pattern is your relationship pattern in business casual.
```

```
Type 3s don't burn out.

They burn toward.

Working 70 hours isn't dedication—it's terror of what happens when they stop producing.

The exhaustion isn't from the work.

It's from the performance of working.

Every vacation is secretly networking.
Every hobby becomes a brand.
Every relationship is an opportunity.

That's not ambition. That's a child still trying to earn approval.
```

### Boss Dynamics

```
Your boss is just their type under pressure:

Type 1 boss: Micromanages because imperfection is existential threat
Type 3 boss: Takes credit because visibility is survival
Type 5 boss: Absent because people drain them
Type 8 boss: Intimidating because vulnerability was punished

They're not terrible leaders.

They're wounded people with authority.

Same as you. Just with a bigger salary.
```

```
Working for a Type 6 boss:

"Can you send me that report?"
(Already has three backup copies)

"Let's touch base about the project"
(Needs reassurance, not information)

"I want your honest opinion"
(Wants validation, will remember disagreement forever)

They're not controlling. They're terrified.

Learn their fear language, and they'll trust you completely.
```

## Threads

### Thread 1: Why You Hate Your Job

```
1/7
You don't hate your job.

You hate the version of yourself you have to be at work.

Here's what your personality is actually struggling with: 🧵

2/7
Type 1s: "Why doesn't anyone else care about doing it right?"

You hate your job because incompetence surrounds you.

Reality: You set standards no one asked for, then resent people for not meeting them.

The job isn't the problem. The inner critic is.

3/7
Type 2s: "I do so much and no one notices"

You hate your job because you're unappreciated.

Reality: You volunteer for everything, expect mind-reading gratitude, then burn out in silence.

The job isn't the problem. The martyrdom is.

4/7
Type 3s: "This isn't challenging me anymore"

You hate your job because you've "outgrown" it.

Reality: You mastered the metrics. Now there's nothing to prove. Boredom feels like death.

The job isn't the problem. The addiction to achievement is.

5/7
Type 5s: "These meetings drain my soul"

You hate your job because people require energy.

Reality: You want to contribute from a cave via email, and human interaction feels like an assault.

The job isn't the problem. The energy hoarding is.

6/7
Type 9s: "I just go along with whatever"

You hate your job because you've merged with it.

Reality: You adapted so well you forgot what you actually want. Now resentment leaks out as passive resistance.

The job isn't the problem. The disappearing is.

7/7
The pattern at work is the pattern everywhere.

Relationships. Friendships. Family.

Same wound. Different setting.

Which workplace pattern have you been running?
```

### Thread 2: Productivity Advice Is Type 3 Propaganda

```
1/6
90% of productivity advice is written by Type 3s for Type 3s.

Here's why it doesn't work for you: 🧵

2/6
"Set ambitious goals and track metrics!"

Works for: Type 3s who get dopamine from achievement
Destroys: Type 9s who freeze under external pressure
Irrelevant to: Type 5s who don't care about your metrics

Productivity isn't one-size-fits-all.

3/6
"Morning routine! 5 AM wake-up! Cold plunge!"

Works for: Type 1s who love discipline-as-identity
Destroys: Type 4s who create best at 2 AM
Irrelevant to: Type 7s who need variety, not routine

Your best work might happen at midnight. That's fine.

4/6
"Time-block everything! Calendar is king!"

Works for: Type 6s who feel safe with structure
Destroys: Type 7s who suffocate without spontaneity
Irrelevant to: Type 5s who need deep work, not segmented attention

Your calendar isn't broken. The advice is.

5/6
"Network! Personal brand! Be visible!"

Works for: Type 3s whose worth = visibility
Destroys: Type 5s who want to contribute from the shadows
Irrelevant to: Type 9s who'd rather die than self-promote

Success doesn't require performance for everyone.

6/6
The productivity system that works for you matches your type's needs:

Type 1: Structure with permission to be imperfect
Type 2: Boundaries (actually)
Type 4: Meaning-first, metrics-second
Type 5: Deep work, minimal meetings
Type 9: External accountability with gentle deadlines

What actually works for YOUR brain?

## Engagement Responses

### When someone shares work frustration:

```
That's textbook Type [X] work pattern.

You're not crazy. You're running the same wound at a desk.

The [specific frustration] comes from [core fear].

What would it look like to work WITH that pattern instead of against it?
```

### When someone asks about dealing with a boss type:

```
Type [X] boss = [core motivation] dressed in authority.

They're not toxic. They're wounded with power.

Speak to [their core fear]: [specific tactic].

Watch them trust you instantly.
```
