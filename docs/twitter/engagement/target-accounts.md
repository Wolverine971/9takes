# Target Accounts for Engagement

**Strategy:** Reply with DJocrates energy. Add savage insight, not polite agreement.

---

## Tier 1: Direct Alignment (10k-100k)

**Reply 3x/week minimum. Be first. Add depth.**

### @ChrisWillx (90k)

- **Why:** Personal development, psychology-backed advice
- **Best time:** Morning (8-10 AM EST)

### @PsychologyToday (75k)

- **Why:** Research + self-improvement, highly active
- **Best time:** Midday (11 AM-1 PM EST)

### @EnneagramInst (30k)

- **Why:** Official Enneagram Institute - authority in niche
- **Best time:** Afternoon (2-4 PM EST)
- **Reply style:** "Type 4's 'authenticity' is often just performing uniqueness. The real growth is being ordinary without dying inside."

### @ModernTherapist (28k)

### @melrobbins (250k)

- **Reply style:** "Type 7s love the 5-second rule because it feels like they're doing something. They're still avoiding the pain. Just faster."

### @PsychCentral (234k)

- **Why:** Mental health clinical content
- **Reply style:** "Type 2s don't burnout from helping. They burnout from the silent scorekeeping nobody asked them to do."

### @jayshetty (300k)

- **Why:** Mindfulness meets purpose
- **Reply style:** "Type 3s hear 'find your purpose' and immediately start optimizing. The purpose of purpose is to stop optimizing."

### @Wealth (400k)

- **Why:** Success psychology
- **Reply style:** "Type 3s chase money for status. Type 5s for security. Type 8s for control. Same ladder. Different wounds."

### @EstherPerel (200k)
