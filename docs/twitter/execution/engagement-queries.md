## Engagement Best Practices

1. **Engage BEFORE posting** - 10-15 mins of replies warms up your network
2. **Reply with insight, not promo** - Add value, don't pitch
3. **Use `/tweet-reply` command** - For crafting natural replies in DJocrates voice
4. **Target posts 1-24 hours old** - Fresh enough to get noticed
5. **Mix high and medium engagement posts** - Don't only reply to viral stuff
6. **Reply to replies** - Conversations in threads get visibility
