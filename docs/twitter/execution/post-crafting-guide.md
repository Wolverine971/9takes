# Twitter/X Post Crafting Guide

**CRITICAL:** This doc covers structure and format. For VOICE (how to sound), read `../voice-and-tone.md` first.

## Quick Reference

| Element         | Single Tweet                        | Thread                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Character Limit | 280 (25,000 with Premium)           | 280 per tweet                             |
| Optimal Length  | 71-100 characters                   | 4-8 tweets                                |

| Engagement      | Easy to share, hashtag-discoverable | 63% more impressions, 54% more engagement |

---

## Part 1: Single Tweet Best Practices

### Character Count Guidelines

- **Standard limit**: 280 characters
- **Optimal engagement length**: 71-100 characters
- **Emojis count as 2 characters** (Unicode encoding)
- **Premium users**: Up to 25,000 characters for long-form posts

### Single Tweet Structure

```
[HOOK - Attention-grabbing opener]
[VALUE - Core message or insight]
[CTA - What you want readers to do] (optional)
```

### When to Use a Single Tweet

✅ **Use single tweets for:**

- Quick insights or observations
- Standalone quotes or wisdom
- Simple questions to spark discussion
- Timely reactions to trending topics
- Punchy one-liners or hot takes
- Content easily discovered via search/hashtags

❌ **Avoid single tweets for:**

- Complex explanations requiring multiple steps
- Stories with narrative arc
- Detailed how-to guides
- Content that benefits from visual progression

---

## Part 2: Thread Best Practices

### Thread Structure

**Tweet 1 (The Hook):**

```
[BOLD STATEMENT or QUESTION]
[PROMISE of what's coming]
[Thread emoji 🧵 or "Thread:" indicator]
```

**Body Tweets (2-7):**

```
[NUMBER or TRANSITION] (optional)
[KEY POINT]
[SUPPORTING DETAIL or EXAMPLE]
```

**Final Tweet:**

```
[SUMMARY/TL;DR]
[CALL TO ACTION]
[LINK if applicable - put links here, NOT in first tweet]
```

### Optimal Thread Length

- **Sweet spot**: 4-8 tweets
- **Maximum recommended**: 10-12 tweets before attention drops
- **Minimum**: 2-3 tweets (otherwise use single tweet)

### When to Use a Thread

✅ **Use threads for:**

- Step-by-step guides and tutorials
- Storytelling with beginning, middle, end
- List-based content (tips, lessons, resources)
- Breaking down complex topics
- Announcing new content with key highlights
- Building authority on a subject
- Trending topic deep-dives

❌ **Avoid threads for:**

- Simple announcements
- Questions seeking quick input
- Content that doesn't build on itself
- Topics that can be expressed in one tweet

### Thread Formatting Tips

1. **Number your tweets** (1/, 2/, 3/ or 1. 2. 3.) for easy navigation
2. **Use line breaks** liberally - walls of text kill engagement
3. **Keep each tweet self-contained** enough to be understood if quoted
4. **Add visuals** to 2-3 tweets within the thread
5. **End each tweet at a natural curiosity point** to encourage continued reading

---

## Part 3: The Hook (Critical for Both)

The hook is the **make-or-break element**. Top creators write 10-15 versions before publishing.

### 6 Hook Types That Work

#### 1. Strong Declarative Statement

```
"Twitter is the most underrated business tool in the world."
"I spent 10 years building the wrong things."
```

#### 2. Thought-Provoking Question

```
"What if everything you know about productivity is wrong?"
"Why do 90% of startups fail in year one?"
```

#### 3. Controversial Opinion

```
"College completely failed in teaching me how to write."
"Most business advice is designed to keep you busy, not successful."
```

#### 4. Moment in Time

```
"In 2019, I was $50,000 in debt with no plan."
"Yesterday I got rejected for the 100th time."
```

#### 5. Vulnerable Statement

```
"I've never admitted this publicly, but..."
"The thing that terrifies me most about building in public:"
```

#### 6. Weird/Unique Insight

```
"The best writers I know don't actually enjoy writing."
"Here's the personality trait most billionaires share (it's not what you think):"
```

### The 4-Part Hook Formula

1. **Bold Statement** - Surprise or shock them
2. **Tension** - Highlight a struggle they relate to
3. **Twist** - Offer unexpected insight
4. **Credibility** (optional) - Show proof/receipts

**Example:**

```
"I grew from 0 to 100K followers in 8 months.

But here's what nobody tells you about 'going viral':

It almost destroyed my mental health.

Here's the real playbook I wish I had (🧵)"
```

## Part 4: Call-to-Action (CTA) Techniques

### CTA Effectiveness Data

| CTA Type        | Engagement Increase |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Ask for Reply   | +334%               |
| Ask for Retweet | +311%               |
| Ask for Follow  | +258%               |

### Best CTA Practices

1. **Spell out "RETWEET"** - performs 2x better than "RT"
2. **Put CTA at the beginning** when possible (not always at end)
3. **Use CAPS** for action words to make them stand out
4. **Leverage reciprocity**: "I gave you X for free, all I ask is..."
5. **Create urgency**: "Don't miss out" beats "Get access"
6. **Use social proof**: "Join 10,000+ others who..."

### CTA Templates

**For Engagement:**

```
"If this resonated, RETWEET the first tweet to help others find it."
"Reply with your biggest takeaway 👇"
"Which tip will you try first? Comment below."
```

**For Growth:**

```
"FOLLOW for daily [topic] insights."
"If you want more [benefit], hit that follow button."
"I share [X] every week. Follow to never miss one."
```

**For Traffic:**

```
"Full guide in the link below 👇"
"Want the complete playbook? Link in reply."
"Get the free template here: [link in final tweet]"
```

## Part 5: Algorithm Optimization

### What the Algorithm Rewards

| Signal                       | Weight/Impact                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Replies                      | **Highest** - 150x boost when you reply to comments on your tweets |
| Retweets                     | 2x more valuable than likes                                        |
| Time-on-post                 | Longer = more reach                                                |
| Visual content               | Videos get 10x engagement                                          |
| Premium/Verified             | 2-4x visibility boost                                              |
| Posting when audience active | Higher ranking                                                     |

### Visibility Boosters

1. **Reply to comments within first hour** - massive boost
2. **Engage before posting** to "wake up" your network
3. **Use native media** (upload directly vs. links)
4. **Avoid external links in first tweet** - put in reply or follow-up
5. **Use quote tweets** instead of plain retweets for more reach
6. **Post threads** - algorithm loves time-on-content

### What Hurts Visibility

- External links in the first tweet
- Too many hashtags (stick to 1-2)
- Posting when audience is inactive
- Low engagement in first hour
- Walls of text without line breaks

---

## Part 6: Hashtag Strategy

### Best Practices

- **Use 1-2 hashtags maximum** per post
- **Optimal hashtag length**: ~6 characters (single word)
- **Place at end** of tweet or integrate naturally
- **Choose moderately popular** hashtags (not oversaturated)
- **Threads don't need hashtags** in every tweet - just the first

### When to Skip Hashtags

- The recommendation algorithm can surface content without hashtags
- Overly promotional content looks spammy with hashtags
- Well-established accounts get reach from followers, not discovery

---

## Part 7: Visual Content Guidelines

### Image Specifications

| Type            | Dimensions    | Max Size |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Single image    | 1200 x 675 px | 5MB      |
| Twitter Card    | 800 x 418 px  | -        |
| Profile picture | 400 x 400 px  | -        |
| Header image    | 1500 x 500 px | -        |

### Video Guidelines

- **Max length**: 2 min 20 sec
- **Optimal length**: Under 60 seconds (most engagement)
- **Native upload** performs better than links
- **Captions/subtitles** increase engagement (most watch without sound)

### Visual Content Impact

- Images increase engagement by 40%
- Videos increase engagement by 10x
- Image carousels encourage swiping (more time-on-post)
- GIFs can make content feel more personable

---

## Part 8: Optimal Posting Times

### Best Overall Times (Data from 1M+ tweets)

| Rank | Day       | Time |
| ---- | --------- | ---- |
| 1    | Wednesday | 9 AM |
| 2    | Tuesday   | 8 AM |
| 3    | Monday    | 8 AM |

### Day-by-Day Breakdown

- **Monday**: 8-10 AM (people check feeds before work)
- **Tuesday**: 10 AM-12 PM, 2-4 PM (peak engagement day)
- **Wednesday**: 9-10 AM (midweek engagement peak)
- **Thursday**: 10 AM-12 PM (similar to Tuesday)
- **Friday**: 9-11 AM (engagement drops afternoon)
- **Saturday/Sunday**: Avoid if possible (lowest engagement)

### Key Timing Insights

- **Tweet lifespan**: 15-20 minutes of peak visibility
- **Posts peak**: 24-36 hours unless they go viral
- **B2B content**: Weekdays during business hours (especially 1-3 PM lunch)
- **Younger audiences**: More active in evenings

## Part 13: Image Generation with Midjourney

Images increase Twitter engagement by 40%. For high-impact posts, generate custom visuals using Midjourney with the 9takes Greek statue aesthetic.

### When to Use Images

**HIGH VALUE** (always recommend):

- Threads (increases read-through rate)
- "9 Takes" format (9 types, 9 reactions)
- Shadow content (manipulation, self-sabotage, toxic traits)
- Mental health content (anxiety, overthinking, depression)
- Emotional/vulnerable content

**MEDIUM VALUE** (suggest when time allows):

- Type-specific deep dives
- Controversial takes
- Quote tweets with strong roast angle

**SKIP IMAGES FOR:**

- Quick questions seeking replies
- Time-sensitive trending takes
- Simple polls
- MBTI bridge quote-tweets (original tweet is the visual)

### 9takes Visual Brand: Greek Statue Aesthetic

All 9takes images use Greek marble statues expressing modern emotions and situations. This creates a distinctive, recognizable brand that conveys:

- Timeless wisdom meets modern psychology
- Classical beauty with psychological depth
- Sophisticated yet accessible

**Core Visual Elements:**

- Marble Greek statues doing contemporary things
- Black/white/grey base palette
- Subtle color accents matching content tone
- Cinematic, moody lighting
- Emotional depth in expressions
- Psychological metaphors visualized

### Twitter Image Specifications

| Element      | Specification                      |

### Type-Specific Accent Colors

When creating images focused on specific Enneagram types, use these color associations:

| Type | Accent Color          | Lighting Mood        | Visual Metaphor                           |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Gold/amber            | Dramatic, judgmental | Scales, measuring tools, magnifying glass |
| 2    | Warm rose/pink        | Soft, glowing heart  | Extended arms, giving gesture, empty cup  |
| 3    | Bright gold spotlight | Achievement, bright  | Podium, trophies, masks                   |
| 4    | Deep purple/blue      | Moody, ethereal      | Dark water reflection, artistic elements  |
| 5    | Cool blue             | Dim, candlelit       | Books, tower, observing from distance     |
| 6    | Amber/warning         | Tension, shadows     | Vigilant stance, protective pose          |
| 7    | Rainbow/vibrant       | Bright, dynamic      | Reaching for glowing orbs, motion         |
| 8    | Deep red              | Dramatic, powerful   | Crossed arms, armor, commanding stance    |
| 9    | Soft neutral          | Diffused, calm       | Mediating pose, slightly transparent      |

### Crafting Custom Prompts

**Step 1: Identify the core emotion/concept**

- What's the psychological truth you're visualizing?
- What would make someone stop scrolling?

**Step 2: Choose the visual metaphor**

- How can a Greek statue embody this concept?
- What action, pose, or setting communicates it?

**Step 3: Add emotional depth**

- What facial expression captures this?
- What's the internal experience?

**Step 4: Set the mood with color/lighting**

- What accent color fits the emotion?
- Dramatic? Moody? Soft? Ethereal?

**Step 5: Apply the technical template**

- Add the standard Unreal Engine/Cinematic parameters
- Use --ar 16:9 for Twitter
- Use --stylize 200 for consistent quality

### Example: From Tweet to Image

**Tweet:** "Type 6s don't ask for reassurance because they don't trust you. They ask because they don't trust themselves."

**Concept:** The internal doubt that drives external seeking

**Visual Metaphor:** Greek statue looking at its own reflection with uncertainty while another statue (representing external validation) waits

**Prompt:**

```
greek statue staring at its own fractured reflection in marble mirror, expression of deep self-doubt and internal questioning, another statue figure waiting in background representing sought reassurance, the reflected image showing uncertainty, amber warning light accents, dramatic shadows, Unreal Engine, Cinematic, portrait Photography, Shot on 50mm lens, Depth of Field, hyper-detailed, beautifully color graded, 32k, Tension Lighting, Global Illumination, Ray Tracing Global Illumination, hypermaximalist, elegant, hyper realistic --ar 16:9 --stylize 200
```

### Post-Generation Workflow

1. **Generate in Midjourney** - Paste the prompt
2. **Select best result** - Pick the image that best captures the concept (U1, U2, U3, or U4)
3. **Upscale** - Use "Upscale (Subtle)" for cleaner finish
4. **Download** - Save the high-res version
5. **Post with tweet** - Attach directly to Twitter
6. **Add alt text** - Describe the image for accessibility
