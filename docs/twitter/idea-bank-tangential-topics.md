## Love Languages & Communication

Type 2: Receiving from others ("Show me I matter by letting me give")
Type 3: Words of Affirmation ("Celebrate my achievements")
Type 4: Quality Time ("See my depth and uniqueness")
Type 5: Space & Understanding ("Respect my boundaries")

What's yours?
```

Type 5: "I need time to process this"
Type 6: "Worst case scenario activated"
Type 7: "Can we make this quick?"
