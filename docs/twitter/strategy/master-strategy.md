# 9takes X/Twitter Growth Strategy 2025

_Goal: Build 9takes as THE psychology-meets-real-life authority on X_

> **Quick Start:** See [`/docs/twitter/README.md`](../README.md) for the hub.
> **Next Post:** See [`/docs/twitter/execution/posts-queue.md`](../execution/posts-queue.md) for ready-to-post content.
> **How to Draft:** See [`/docs/twitter/execution/post-crafting-guide.md`](../execution/post-crafting-guide.md) for post structure.
> **Claude Command:** Use `/twitter` to get AI help with content.

---

## Executive Summary

9takes has a unique opportunity on X: **you're not another personality type explainer—you're the account that shows why people are stuck and how to get unstuck.**

Your blog content proves the formula: mental health angles + personality context = engagement. This strategy adapts that winning formula for X.

**Core positioning:** "One situation. 9 ways to see it. 9 ways to get unstuck."

---

## Strategic Frameworks for X Growth

**What this section is:** These frameworks help you create content that matches where your audience is in their journey. Most accounts fail not because their content is bad, but because it's delivered to the wrong audience at the wrong time.

**Where these come from:** Adapted from the Viral Coach Masterclass, a professional content coaching course focused on short-form video and social media growth.

> **Deep dive:** [`/docs/marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](../../marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md) — Full course notes with detailed explanations, video timestamps, and 9takes-specific applications.

### 1. The Short-Form Funnel (ToF/MoF/BoF)

All content falls into three funnel stages. **Know which stage you're creating for:**

| Stage                | Purpose                            | Content Type                                       | % of Posts |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Top of Funnel**    | Reach new people, boost visibility | Broad appeal, observations, "9 takes" posts        | 50%        |
| **Middle of Funnel** | Build trust, showcase expertise    | Deep insights, patterns, mental health connections | 35%        |
| **Bottom of Funnel** | Convert to action                  | Direct CTAs, link to blog, newsletter, platform    | 15%        |

**Key insight:** Most accounts over-index on bottom-of-funnel. You need 80% give, 20% ask.

### 2. Trust Onion Framework 🧅

Your audience places blame at different layers. **Match your content to where they are:**

| Layer                        | Who They Blame                       | Content Strategy                                        | Example Post                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Outer (Circumstances)**    | Time, money, algorithms, dating apps | Practical tips, quick wins, validate external struggles | "Why dating apps make Type 6s more anxious"           |
| **Middle (Specific People)** | Boss, ex, parents, friends           | Strategic advice, pattern recognition                   | "Why your parents' type shaped your attachment style" |
| **Inner (Self)**             | Take personal responsibility         | Motivational, coaching content                          | "The lie you keep telling yourself (by type)"         |

**Critical insight:** Most new followers are at the OUTER layer. Your current content skips to the INNER layer. Add more "circumstances" content to meet people where they are.

### 3. EEO Continuum (Voice Calibration)

**Calibrate your voice based on audience trust level:**

| Voice           | Description                       | Best For                             | Example                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Observation** | Publicly verifiable data/patterns | Top of funnel (new followers)        | "I noticed Type 5s tend to..."     |
| **Experience**  | Personal stories and results      | Middle of funnel                     | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| **Expert**      | Authoritative statements          | Bottom of funnel (established trust) | "Type 5s do X because..."          |

**Your current voice:** Heavy Expert. This works for people who already trust you.
**What to add:** More Observation and Experience voice for new followers.

### 4. Give-to-Ask Ratio

Track your "gives" (pure value) vs "asks" (CTAs).

| Ratio              | Effect                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 90% give / 10% ask | Builds maximum brand equity, slower conversion |
| 80% give / 20% ask | **Sweet spot for growth phase**                |
| 70% give / 30% ask | Acceptable for established accounts            |
| <70% give          | Damages brand equity, feels salesy             |

**Track weekly:** Count your posts. How many had a CTA vs pure value?

## Part 1: Brand Identity on X

### The 9takes X Persona

**What you are:**

- The psychology account that doesn't just describe—it diagnoses AND prescribes
- The friend who studied psychology but talks like a real person
- The account that says what people feel but can't articulate

**What you're NOT:**

- A generic personality type explainer
- An academic psychology account
- A motivational quote account
- A meme-only account

### Brand Voice on X

| Element  | Do                                      | Don't                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Tone     | Direct, slightly provocative, confident | Hedging, overly academic, preachy |
| Language | "Your type does X because..."           | "Some people might tend to..."    |
| Format   | Short punchy sentences. Line breaks.    | Wall of text paragraphs           |
| Emotion  | Name the uncomfortable truth            | Sugarcoat or hedge                |
| Value    | Practical insight in every post         | Empty observations                |

### Signature Phrases to Own

Build recognition through consistent language patterns:

- "Your brain isn't broken. It's running protection software."
- "This isn't a character flaw—it's a pattern. And patterns can be interrupted."
- "9 types. 9 ways to be stuck. 9 ways out."
- "The reason generic advice doesn't work for you:"
- "What [feeling] actually means for your type:"

### Visual Identity

- **Profile pic:** Clean, professional, memorable (consider the 9takes logo or a distinctive avatar)
- **Header:** "One question. 9 perspectives. See the emotions behind every take." + URL
- **Bio formula:** [What you do] + [Who it's for] + [Proof/credibility] + [CTA]
  - Example: "Why you're stuck → by personality type. 300+ deep dives. Mental health meets Enneagram. Link to your type below 👇"

## Part 2: Content Pillars

**Updated Distribution (incorporating bridge strategy):**
| Pillar | % of Posts | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Shadow Content | 30% | Core engagement driver |
| Mental Health + Personality | 25% | Traffic driver |
| MBTI Bridge Roasts | 20% | **NEW** — Growth driver (brings outsiders in) |
| Relationship Reality | 15% | Shareable content |
| "One Situation, 9 Takes" | 10% | Signature differentiator |

**Bridge Content = 70% of growth.** The existing choir will find you. Your job is to attack outsiders until they feel seen.

---

### Pillar 1: Shadow Content (30% of posts)

**What it is:** The uncomfortable truths about each type—manipulation, self-sabotage, toxic patterns, why relationships fail.

**Why it works:** Your GSC data proves it—toxic traits (4.8% CTR) vastly outperforms generic content (0.3% CTR). People want to understand dark patterns.

**Post examples:**

```
Type 2 manipulation playbook:

"After everything I've done for you..."
"I'm not mad, just disappointed."
"No one appreciates me."

It's not evil. It's protection learned in childhood.

But recognizing it? That's the first step to stopping.
```

```
How each type self-sabotages success:

1 - Perfection paralysis (nothing's ever good enough to ship)
2 - Martyrdom burnout (give until empty, resent everyone)
3 - Workaholism (success = worth, crash incoming)
4 - Comparison spiral ("they have what I lack")
5 - Analysis paralysis (need more info before acting)
6 - Catastrophizing (prepare for disaster, never start)
7 - Shiny object syndrome (start everything, finish nothing)
8 - Bridge burning (my way or no way)
9 - Numbing procrastination (peace through avoidance)

Which one hit you?
```

### Pillar 2: Mental Health + Personality (30% of posts)

**What it is:** Connecting anxiety, depression, ADHD, overthinking to personality patterns. Your proven traffic winner.

**Why it works:** 6.7% CTR on mental health content—your highest performer. People search for problems, not descriptions.

**Post examples:**

```
Why "just stop overthinking" doesn't work:

Your Enneagram type has a specific thought loop.

Type 1: "Did I do the right thing?" (moral perfectionism)
Type 6: "What could go wrong?" (threat scanning)
Type 4: "Why did I feel that?" (emotional archaeology)

Different loops need different interventions.
```

```
The ADHD-Enneagram connection no one talks about:

Type 7s get misdiagnosed with ADHD constantly.
Both love novelty. Both struggle with follow-through.

But the root is different:
- ADHD: Dopamine dysregulation
- Type 7: Running from inner emptiness

Treatment that ignores the difference fails.
```

### Pillar 3: Relationship Reality (20% of posts)

**What it is:** Dating red flags, communication breakdowns, why you keep attracting the same problems.

**Why it works:** Relationship content has universal appeal and high share potential.

**Post examples:**

```
Red flags you're dating each type:

1 - Criticizes everything you do (including how you load the dishwasher)
2 - Keeps score of every favor
3 - Only shows you off when it benefits them
4 - Makes every conversation about their feelings
5 - Goes silent for days without explanation
6 - Tests your loyalty constantly
7 - Avoids every serious conversation
8 - Steamrolls your opinions
9 - Agrees to your face, resents you quietly

Which one do you keep attracting?
```

```
Why Type 2s and Type 8s keep finding each other:

2 wants to be needed.
8 needs someone who won't leave.

Looks like chemistry.
Actually trauma bonding.

The fix isn't finding a different type.
It's healing what makes the pattern feel like home.
```

### Pillar 4: MBTI Bridge Roasts (15% of posts) — NEW

**What it is:** Quote-tweeting viral MBTI content with savage Enneagram translations. The goal: make MBTI people feel _attacked_ by something they didn't know existed.

**Why it works:** MBTI Twitter is 50-100x larger than Enneagram Twitter. They're curious but defensive. Your roast makes them go "wait… how did you know that?" → sends them to 9takes.

**The formula:** Find viral MBTI tweet → Quote-tweet with "MBTI is the mask, Enneagram is the wound" energy

**Post examples:**

```
[Quote-tweeting viral "INTJs are just built different" post]

INTJ is a costume.

Half of you are disintegrated 5s hoarding knowledge like a dragon on Red Bull.

The other half are 8s who took the test when angry.

The Enneagram sees what MBTI hides.
```

```
[Quote-tweeting "ENFP energy ✨" post]

ENFP is the mask.

Real question: Are you a 7 running from pain or a 4 romanticizing it?

One of you needs more fun. The other needs less.

Figure out which and your life changes.
```

```
[Quote-tweeting "INFJ door slam" meme]

INFJs door-slam like it's a mic drop.

But as an Enneagram 9, you're just numbing out conflict you invented.

As a 4, you're making an exit more dramatic than the actual offense.

MBTI tells you what you do. Enneagram tells you why you can't stop.
```

```
[Quote-tweeting "INTP conspiracy" meme]

INTPs theorize conspiracies like it's a side quest.

But as a Type 6? You're not curious—you're loyalty-testing the universe.

"What if everything I trust is lying to me?"

That's not a thought experiment. That's a core wound.
```

**How to find targets:**

- Search "MBTI" on X, filter to "Top" posts from last 7 days
- Look for 10k+ likes (those audiences are primed)
- Prioritize posts with defensive energy ("X type is just built different")
- Ask Grok: "Show me top MBTI tweets from the last 7 days with 50k+ engagements"

**Posting strategy:**

- 2-3 MBTI bridge posts per week
- Best days: Tuesday, Thursday evenings when MBTI crowd is active
- Always end with a line that hints at Enneagram depth ("MBTI tells you what. Enneagram tells you why.")

---

### Secondary Bridge Tactics (Layer onto any pillar)

**Astrology Bridge:**
Astrology girls are exhausted with surface-level horoscopes. They crave depth. Bait-and-switch works:

```
Scorpio, but the version your therapist knows:

You don't hold grudges—you hold evidence.

When someone wrongs you, you catalog the date, the words, and the exact tone they used.

Not for revenge. For protection.

Because you know: if you let it go, you'll let them hurt you again.

This is actually Enneagram Type 8.

If this hit different, the unfiltered version is here: 9takes.com/enneagram-type-8
```

**Pop Culture Bridge:**
Weekly thread: "If you sobbed at [scene from current hot show], congratulations, you just met your core fear."

Current goldmines (late 2025):

- The Bear (literally every character)
- Severance (Irving = 1, Mark = 9)
- Arcane season 2
- Dune (Paul = 6 disintegrating to 3)

```
Everyone relates to different Succession characters.

Your choice reveals your wound:

- Kendall: Type 3 (needing dad's approval to feel real)
- Shiv: Type 8 (power as protection from vulnerability)
- Roman: Type 7 (jokes as armor against feeling anything)
- Connor: Type 9 (invisible child seeking relevance)

Which one made you uncomfortable?
```

**Childhood Wounds Bridge:**
Therapy-speak is everywhere on X. Enneagram nails childhood wounds better than almost any system.

```
The sentence you heard as a child that still controls you:

Type 1: "We love you, but can you do it correctly?"
Type 2: "I don't need anything, go play."
Type 3: "Wow, look at [sibling] go!"
Type 4: "Why can't you just be normal?"
Type 5: "You're so sensitive. Toughen up."
Type 6: "You can't trust anyone but family."
Type 7: "Stop crying. Look on the bright side."
Type 8: "You have to be strong or they'll eat you alive."
Type 9: "Don't make waves. Keep the peace."

If one of these just punched you in the chest, I'm sorry.

But now you know where it came from.
```

### Grok Prompts for Real-Time Content Mining

Since Grok has direct X data access, use these prompts weekly:

**For MBTI targets:**

```
Show me the top 10 MBTI tweets from the last 7 days with highest engagement. Which ones have defensive energy like "X type is just built different" that I could roast?
```

**For timing optimization:**

```
What are the exact posting times and days when Enneagram/personality content gets the most engagement on X right now? Give me specific hours.
```

**For audience research:**

```
Which accounts in the MBTI/astrology space have audiences most likely to convert to Enneagram interest? Show me their engagement patterns and what content they share most.
```

**For content hooks:**

```
What specific phrases or formats in tweets about personality types are getting the highest bookmark-to-like ratios right now?
```

**For therapy-speak crossover:**

```
Show me viral tweets about therapy, inner child, or attachment styles from the last 30 days. Which core fears/Enneagram types map to each?
```

**For pop culture hooks:**

```
What pop culture moments (shows, characters, scenes) are trending in personality-adjacent conversations this week?
```

---

### Pillar 5: "One Situation, 9 Takes" (10% of posts)

**What it is:** Your unique format—same scenario, 9 different internal experiences. This is your signature differentiator.

**Why it works:** Instantly shareable. People tag friends. Shows the depth of your framework.

**Post examples:**

```
Your friend cancels plans last minute.

Type 1: "How irresponsible."
Type 2: "Did I do something wrong?"
Type 3: "Whatever, I'll be productive instead."
Type 4: "No one really wants to see me."
Type 5: "Honestly, relieved."
Type 6: "Are they mad at me?"
Type 7: "Already planning something better."
Type 8: "They'll hear about this."
Type 9: "It's fine." (It's not fine.)

Which one are you?
```

```
You got passed over for a promotion.

Type 1: "This is unfair. I deserved it."
Type 2: "I gave everything and this is what I get?"
Type 3: "What did they have that I don't?"
Type 4: "Of course. I'm never recognized."
Type 5: "Politics. I knew it wasn't merit-based."
Type 6: "Did someone say something about me?"
Type 7: "Their loss. Something better will come."
Type 8: "Time to have a direct conversation."
Type 9: "Maybe it's fine. I didn't want the stress."

All 9 reactions to the same moment.
```

## Part 2.5: Writing Quality Checks

### Reading Level Check

> "A huge portion of the population has a reading level below 6th grade."

**Before posting any thread:**

1. Paste your text into [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
2. Target Grade 6 or lower
3. Simplify complex sentences
4. Replace jargon with everyday words

**Why this matters:** Simpler content reaches more people. Complexity isn't intelligence—clarity is.

### Time to Value & Value to Time

| Metric            | Goal    | What It Means                                 |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Time to Value** | LOW 📉  | Get to the point FAST. Hook in first 5 words. |
| **Value to Time** | HIGH 📈 | Pack maximum insight into minimum words.      |

**The test:** Would someone bookmark this? If not, add more value or cut more fluff.

### Hook Quality Check

> "The first 5 seconds are crucial. If your hook is bad, the rest doesn't matter."

**Hook rules:**

1. ✅ Specific beats generic ("Type 2s" beats "some people")
2. ✅ Problem beats description ("Why you're stuck" beats "About Type 2")
3. ❌ Never beg ("Please read this" or "This is important")
4. ❌ Never generic ("Here's something interesting")

**Test your hook:** Does it work WITHOUT the rest of the post? If someone only saw the first line, would they stop scrolling?

## Part 6: Content Repurposing System (The Flywheel)

### The Content Flywheel Concept

> Reuse your content to create momentum. The more you create, the faster the wheel spins.

**Trust Hierarchy:**

- Long-form blog content → Builds deep trust
- X threads → Builds moderate trust
- Single tweets → Builds awareness (low trust)
- Reels/short video → Widest reach, lowest trust per impression

**The Rule:** Start with what you're comfortable creating, then repurpose DOWN the trust ladder.

### Blog → X Pipeline

Every new blog post should generate:

1. **1 Thread** (main content broken into 6-10 tweets)
2. **3-5 Single Tweets** (individual insights from the post)
3. **1 "9 Takes" Post** (if applicable)
4. **1 Question/Poll** (from FAQ section)
5. **1 Repost** (schedule the best performer for 4-6 weeks later)

**Example: "How Each Type Self-Sabotages" blog → X content:**

**Thread:**

```
Tweet 1:
You're smart. You work hard.

So why do you keep hitting the same walls?

Your Enneagram type has a specific self-sabotage pattern.

Here's how to finally break it: 🧵

[Tweets 2-10: Each type's pattern]

Final Tweet:
Full breakdown with strategies to stop each pattern:
[link]

Which type hit you hardest? Reply below.
```

**Single Tweet 1:**

```
Type 7s don't have commitment issues.

They have "sitting with discomfort" issues.

New projects feel like possibility.
Finishing feels like limitation.

The fix: Finish ONE thing before starting anything new.
Just one.
```

**Single Tweet 2:**

```
The Type 1 self-sabotage loop:

"It's not perfect yet"
→ Can't ship
→ Misses deadline
→ Feels like failure
→ "See, I knew I wasn't good enough"
→ Next time must be MORE perfect

Interrupt it: Ship something intentionally imperfect.
The world won't end.
```

**Question:**

```
When you're close to success, do you:

A) Raise your standards until it's impossible
B) Give so much you burn out
C) Work until you crash
D) Compare yourself until you quit
E) Keep researching instead of acting
F) Imagine what could go wrong
G) Get bored and start something new
H) Create conflict that derails it
I) Procrastinate and numb out

Reply with your letter. I'll tell you your type.
```

## Part 7: Collaboration & Competitor Strategy

### The Famous Person Effect Warning

> **Don't copy strategies from accounts with 100K+ followers.**

Big accounts succeed with strategies that ONLY work because they're famous. Their "just be authentic" advice ignores that they have built-in reach.

**Instead:** Study accounts at 10K-50K followers (slightly ahead of you). What's working for them RIGHT NOW is what will work for you.

### Competitor Research System (Do This Monthly)

**Step 1: Identify Your "Slightly Ahead" Accounts**

Find 5-7 accounts in the personality/psychology space with 10K-50K followers:

- [ ] Account 1: **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** (followers: **\_**)
- [ ] Account 2: **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** (followers: **\_**)
- [ ] Account 3: **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** (followers: **\_**)
- [ ] Account 4: **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** (followers: **\_**)
- [ ] Account 5: **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** (followers: **\_**)

**Step 2: Use SortFeed or Manual Research**

For each account, identify:

1. Their top 10 performing posts (by likes/retweets)
2. Common themes in high performers
3. Hook patterns they use
4. What they AVOID doing
5. Posting frequency and timing

**Step 3: Reframe, Don't Copy**

Take successful topics and reframe for your audience:

- Their viral post about anxiety? → "How each type experiences anxiety differently"
- Their popular dating take? → "Why your type keeps attracting the same problems"

**80/20 Rule:** Focus deeply on 3-5 accounts rather than superficially tracking 20.

### Target Accounts to Engage With

**⚠️ Warning: These are for ENGAGEMENT, not strategy copying**

**Psychology/Self-Help (100K+ followers):**

- @AdamMGrant (organizational psychology)
- @JamesClear (habits, personal development)
- @Naval (philosophy, self-improvement)
- @SahilBloom (personal growth)
- @RyanHoliday (stoicism)

**Personality/Enneagram Space:**

- @Trulogie (personality content)
- @PersonalityMax (MBTI content)
- Any Enneagram coaches with active X presence

**Strategy:**

1. Reply thoughtfully to their posts with type-based perspective
2. Quote tweet with added insight (not just agreement)
3. Create "response threads" to their popular posts (adding Enneagram lens)

### Collaboration Ideas

1. **Guest threads:** Write a thread for another account's audience
2. **Joint Q&A:** "Which type are you? We'll break down your pattern"
3. **Cross-commentary:** They post about a topic, you add the type perspective
4. **Mutual promotion:** Share each other's best content

---

## Part 7.5: Repost & Reframe Strategies

### Reposting Your Own Content

> "Truly good content is still good months from now."

**Why repost:** Reposting successful tweets can generate thousands of extra views with minimal effort. New followers haven't seen your old content.

**Repost Schedule:**

| Original Performance | Repost After | Repost Again |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 100+ likes           | 4 weeks      | 3 months     |
| 50-99 likes          | 6 weeks      | 4 months     |
| 25-49 likes          | 8 weeks      | 6 months     |

**Repost System:**

1. **Track your top 20 posts** in a spreadsheet
2. **Add repost dates** to your content calendar
3. **Slight variations allowed:** Change the hook, same core content
4. **Best times to repost:** Different day/time than original

### Reframing Others' Viral Content

**The Reframe Method:**

1. Find viral content in adjacent niches (mental health, relationships, productivity)
2. Ask: "How would this look through an Enneagram lens?"
3. Create your version with YOUR perspective and audience

**Examples:**

| Viral Post You Saw                      | Your Reframe                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "5 signs you're burnt out"              | "How each type burns out differently (and how to recover)" |
| "Why you keep dating the wrong people"  | "The dating pattern your Enneagram type keeps repeating"   |
| "Morning routines of successful people" | "The morning routine each type actually needs"             |

**Rules:**

- ✅ Reframe the TOPIC with your perspective
- ✅ Credit inspiration when obvious
- ❌ Never copy hooks or language directly
- ❌ Never pretend ideas are original if they're not

## Part 9: Content Bank (Ready-to-Post Ideas)

### Trust Onion Content Bank

These posts are categorized by Trust Onion layer. Prioritize Outer Layer for new followers:

**Outer Layer (Circumstances) - For NEW followers:**

1. "Why dating apps are harder for certain personality types"
2. "The algorithm knows your type (and it's exploiting it)"
3. "5 workplace policies that secretly favor certain types"
4. "Why modern hustle culture burns out Type 2s and 9s first"
5. "The economy is harder on some types than others"
6. "Social media was designed by 7s for 7s (here's why you're exhausted)"
7. "Remote work vs office: Which types are getting screwed"
8. "Why therapy doesn't work the same for every type"
9. "The education system failed these 3 types worst"
10. "Dating in 2025 vs 2015: How it changed for each type"

**Middle Layer (Specific People) - For growing followers:**

1. "Why your parents' type determined your attachment style"
2. "The manager type that will always overlook you"
3. "Why your ex keeps coming back (by their type)"
4. "Types that bring out your worst... and why you're drawn to them"
5. "The friend type that drains you vs fills you"

**Inner Layer (Self) - For established followers only:**

1. "The lie your type tells yourself every morning"
2. "Your type's biggest excuse (and why it's BS)"
3. "What your type needs to hear but won't accept"

### MBTI Bridge Queue (Ready to Quote-Tweet)

**Based on Grok's Dec 2025 viral tweet analysis:**

1. **Target:** INTJ "chaotic wizard planning" memes

```
INTJs think they're master planners.

Enneagram clocks you as a 5 hoarding knowledge like a dragon on Red Bull.

"I have contingency plans for my contingency plans... that I forgot to execute because I was reading about contingency plans."

MBTI is the resume. Enneagram is the therapy session.
```

2. **Target:** ENFP "17 epiphanies in therapy" posts

```
ENFPs epiphany-dump in therapy like fireworks.

But Type 7, you? Just reframing boredom as a "growth adventure."

"Wait, is existential dread my new hobby?"

The epiphanies are real. Following through on them is where you ghost yourself.
```

3. **Target:** INFJ "door slam" content

```
INFJs door-slam like it's a mic drop.

But let's be honest:

As a Type 9, you're just numbing out conflict you invented.
As a Type 4, you're making an exit more dramatic than the actual offense.

Either way, you're running from something you haven't named yet.
```

4. **Target:** INTP "conspiracy theorist" memes

```
INTPs collect conspiracy theories like Pokémon.

But as a Type 6? You're not curious—you're loyalty-testing reality itself.

"What if the moon landing was fake? What if my friends secretly hate me? What if trust is a trap?"

Same algorithm. Different packaging.
```

5. **Target:** INFP "fanfic about my barista" posts

```
INFPs writing fanfic about their barista: "What if he's a lost prince?"

Type 4 reality: You're not being romantic. You're avoiding the real person because they might disappoint you.

Imaginary connection is safe. Real intimacy is terrifying.

That's not creativity. That's a defense mechanism.
```

6. **Target:** ENTJ "networking shark" content

```
ENTJs at networking events: "This small talk is inefficient—let's cut to the merger proposal."

Type 8 translation: You're not efficient. You're terrified of being controlled by someone else's agenda.

Small talk = vulnerability = potential weakness.

Your "directness" is armor, not strategy.
```

7. **Target:** ISFJ "remembers your birthday from 1997" posts

```
ISFJs remembering your birthday from 1997 while forgetting their own.

Type 2 wound exposed: You track what you give so you can justify asking for what you need.

"See how much I remember? Now you OWE me attention."

That's not love. That's a ledger.
```

**Viral thread to post THIS WEEK:**

```
MBTI is the mask you show the world.
Enneagram is the childhood wound you're still bleeding from.

Quick, brutal translation: 🧵

INTJ → 5 in armor (hoarding knowledge to feel safe)
ENFP → 7 in glitter (running from emptiness with enthusiasm)
INFJ → 4 or 9 in costume (dramatic withdrawal or numbed-out peace)
INTP → 5 or 6 (analysis as protection, doubt as loyalty test)
ENTJ → 8 in a suit (control as defense against betrayal)
ISFJ → 2 in disguise (giving as currency for love)
ESTP → 7 or 8 (action to avoid feeling, intensity to avoid vulnerability)
ENFJ → 2 or 3 (performance as love language)

If one of these just punched you in the chest, I'm sorry.

But also here's your full breakdown: 9takes.com
```

## Part 12: The Bottom Line

Your content advantage is clear: **problem-focused psychology with personality-based precision.**

Generic personality accounts describe types. You diagnose patterns and prescribe fixes.

Generic mental health accounts give universal advice. You explain why it doesn't work for YOUR type.

That's the positioning. Own it.

**The formula:** Mental Health + Enneagram + Direct Language + Practical Solutions = 9takes on X

**Your voice:** "Here's why you're stuck. Here's why it's not your fault. Here's what to actually do about it."

**Your promise:** "Finally understand yourself—and stop making the same mistakes."

Now go post. Consistency beats perfection. The algorithm rewards showing up.
