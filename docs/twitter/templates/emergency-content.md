# Emergency Content Bank

**When you're stuck, grab and post.** Every item here hits 3+ voice traits.

---

## One-Liner Gut Punches (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Shadow Content (30%)

```
Type 2s don't give love. They give auditions.
```

```
Type 3s will have a panic attack in the bathroom and come back to the meeting smiling. That's not resilience. That's performance under duress.
```

```
Type 8s will threaten to leave at 2 AM over a text tone, then Venmo you $400 the next morning with "for therapy, love you."
```

```
Type 4s will dead-ass romanticize their seasonal depression because at least it's *theirs*.
```

```
Type 6s don't trust you. But they don't trust themselves either. That's the wound.
```

```
Type 9s saying "I'm fine" is the biggest lie in human history. They're not fine. They're drowning but decided making waves would be worse.
```

```
Type 1s live in a courtroom in their head where they're both the prosecutor AND the defendant. The verdict is always guilty.
```

```
Type 5s don't ghost you because they're rude. They ghost you because your emotional needs feel like a vampire sucking their life force.
```

```
Type 7s will plan 6 vacations to avoid sitting with one emotion.
```

```
Your Enneagram type is just your childhood survival strategy that overstayed its welcome.
```

```
The pattern isn't bad luck. It's you. And "it's you" isn't an insult—it's the first step to changing.
```

### Mental Health (25%)

```
ADHD isn't your excuse. It's your explanation. There's a difference.
```

```
High-functioning doesn't mean okay. It means good at hiding.
```

```
Type 6 anxiety is just vigilance that never gets a day off.
```

```
Depression is fluent in every type's core fear. It lies to you in your native language.
```

```
The mask isn't protecting you. It's just hiding the exhaustion.
```

```
Type 3 anxiety: Panic attack in the bathroom. Fixed makeup. Back to the meeting. Nobody noticed.
```

```
Your doom-scrolling isn't boredom. It's avoidance with WiFi.
```

```
Type 7s don't avoid pain. They just run faster than it can catch them. (Temporarily.)
```

### Relationships (15%)

```
Your love language is just your childhood wound in relationship form.
```

```
Type 2 + Type 8 relationships: Looks like chemistry. Actually trauma bonding.
```

```
Type 4s don't need Quality Time because they're romantic. They need it because being alone with someone who truly sees them is the only proof they're not fundamentally broken.
```

```
Type 6s create the abandonment they fear by testing until people fail.
```

```
Type 9s don't ghost you because they lost interest. They ghost because deciding to end it feels like violence.
```

```
Type 3s will date who they SHOULD love, not who they DO love. Then wonder why intimacy feels like performance.
```

### MBTI Bridge (20%)

```
INTJ is a costume. Half of you are Type 5s avoiding people. Half are Type 1s who think being right = being good.
```

```
Every INFP thinks they're a Type 4. Half of you are Type 9s who just want to be left alone with your feelings.
```

```
MBTI tells you WHAT you do. Enneagram tells you WHY you can't stop.
```

```
Your MBTI is your behavior. Your Enneagram is the wound driving it.
```

### 9 Takes Format (10%)

```
Same moment. 9 internal experiences. The Enneagram isn't about boxes—it's about realizing everyone's watching a different movie.
```

```
One situation. Nine ways to ruin it. That's the Enneagram.
```

## Controversial Takes (Use Sparingly)

```
Controversial: The Enneagram is just astrology for people who went to therapy. Except it actually works.
```

```
Hot take: Your Enneagram type is why you're still single. Not your looks. Not your luck. Your unconscious pattern.
```

```
Unpopular opinion: Most people are mistyped because they picked the type they WANT to be, not the type they ARE.
```

```
Spicy truth: 90% of productivity advice is written by Type 3s for Type 3s. That's why it doesn't work for you.
```

```
Uncomfortable reality: You don't hate your job. You hate the version of yourself you have to be at work.
```

## Wisdom Drops (End-of-Day Energy)

```
The Enneagram isn't about changing who you are. It's about seeing who you've been. So you can choose who you become.
```

```
Your type is your curriculum. Not your conclusion. The lesson you're here to learn—not the limit of who you can be.
```

```
We don't have personality types. Personality types have us. Until we see them.
```

```
The pattern isn't the person. But they gotta see it to stop it.
```

## Quick Creation Formulas

When stuck, use these templates:

**Formula 1: Type + Brutal Truth + Hug**

```
Type [X] does [brutal observation].
It's not [harsh judgment]. It's [reframe with compassion].
The pattern is the protection. Time to outgrow it.
```

**Formula 2: Quote What They Say + Translation**

```
Type [X] says: "[common phrase]"
Translation: "[what they actually mean/fear]"
```

**Formula 3: Comparison That Hits**

```
[Other framework] tells you [what].
Enneagram tells you [why].
```

**Formula 4: The Wound Reveal**

```
Type [X]s don't [behavior] because [surface reason].
They do it because [childhood wound].
That's not [negative label]—that's survival that overstayed its welcome.
```

## Emergency Rules

1. **Stuck on ideas?** Pick a type and roast them with love
2. **Low energy?** Post a question hook and let replies do the work
3. **No time?** Copy-paste a one-liner from above
4. **Need engagement?** Use a poll
5. **Everything feels weak?** Add more specificity until it feels like espionage

**The goal:** Maintain momentum, not create masterpieces.
