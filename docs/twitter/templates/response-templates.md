# Response Templates

**Voice reminder:** Attack + Hug. Savage accuracy → genuine understanding. Never polite. Always specific.

---

## Handling Skeptics

### "This is just astrology/pseudoscience"

**The Roast + Redirect:**

```
Astrology: "Mercury is in retrograde, that's why you texted your ex"

Enneagram: "You texted your ex because you're a Type 4 who confuses longing for love and absence for intimacy"

One blames the stars. One blames the childhood wound.

Which feels more useful?
```

**The Quick Hit:**

```
Astrology tells you the universe made you this way.

Enneagram tells you childhood trauma made you this way.

One is comforting. One is actionable.

Pick your poison.
```

**The Confession:**

```
I thought the same thing until I read my type and felt personally attacked by a website.

"How do they know I do that?"

Because it's a pattern. And patterns don't lie.
```

---

### "I'm multiple types"

**The Reality Check:**

```
That's like saying you're multiple zodiac signs.

You're not. You just have:
- A core type (the wound)
- Wings (the neighbors)
- Stress/growth points (where you go when life gets too real)

You feel like 4 types because you're human. You ARE one type because that wound runs deep.

What's the fear you can't shake?
```

**The Short Version:**

```
Everyone feels like multiple types.

That's because you have all 9 in you.

But only one controls your 3 AM spirals.

Which one is that?
```

---

### "This is limiting/puts people in boxes"

**The Flip:**

```
The Enneagram doesn't put you in a box.

It shows you the box you've been living in since age 7.

Unconsciously. On autopilot. Running the same pattern like it's your personality when really it's your prison.

Seeing the box is step one to leaving it.
```

**The One-Liner:**

```
You're already in a box.

You just don't know which one.

That's not freedom. That's denial with extra steps.
```

---

### "Can your type change?"

**The Clarity:**

```
Your type doesn't change. Your relationship with it does.

A Type 8 will always have that instinct to control.

But a healthy 8 protects instead of dominates.

Same wiring. Different expression.

The wound stays. The behavior evolves.
```

---

## Type Identification Comments

### "I think I'm Type [X]"

**The Probe:**

```
Type [X] is a good guess.

Quick test: What's the thought you can't stop having?

Type [X]: "[specific intrusive thought]"
Type [similar]: "[different intrusive thought]"

Which one wakes you up at 3 AM?
```

**The Validation + Push:**

```
That [specific thing they mentioned] is textbook Type [X].

The [behavior] comes from [core fear].

Real question: Do you fear [X fear] or [related type fear] more?

That's where the truth is.
```

---

### "I relate to all of them"

**The Challenge:**

```
Everyone relates to all 9.

That's the easy part.

The hard part is admitting which one controls you.

Which type description made you defensive?

That's probably the one.
```

---

## Relationship Comments

### "My partner is Type [X]"

**The Dynamic Breakdown:**

```
Type [X] + your type = [specific dynamic].

Translation: They [behavior] because they fear [fear].

You interpret it as [what you think it means].

They mean it as [what they actually mean].

Same moment. Two different movies.

What's the pattern you keep running into?
```

### "How do I date a Type [X]?"

**The Cheat Code:**

```
Type [X] needs to feel [core desire].

What kills it: [trigger behavior]
What heals it: [what they actually need]

Stop [common mistake]. Start [specific action].

They'll open up when they don't feel [core fear].

What draws you to [X]s anyway?
```

---

## Workplace Comments

### "My boss is Type [X]"

**The Decode:**

```
Type [X] boss = [core motivation] running the show.

What they want: [specific thing]
What triggers them: [specific thing]
How to speak their language: [specific approach]

Stop fighting it. Start translating.

What's the pattern driving you crazy?
```

---

## Mental Health Comments

### Vulnerable shares about struggles

**The Hug (still with edge):**

```
This pattern isn't a character flaw.

It's Type [X]'s survival strategy from when [childhood context].

The [specific behavior] kept you safe once.

Now it's keeping you stuck.

That's not weakness. That's old protection still running.

What would it look like to need less protection?
```

**The Normalization:**

```
Every Type [X] I know has this pattern.

[Specific struggle] comes from [core fear].

You're not broken. You're running code written when you were 7.

Time to update the software.
```

---

## Quick Engagement Responses

### Agreement (with value add)

```
"This is exactly what Type [X] does. The [specific detail] is chef's kiss accuracy."

"Type [X] checking in. Feeling extremely called out. Not even mad."

"The [specific part]? That's not a personality trait. That's a trauma response in a trench coat."
```

### Adding insight

```
"This + the fact that Type [X]s do this because [deeper motivation]. Same behavior. Different wound."

"Related: Type [X] does the opposite for the same reason. Both are avoiding [core fear]."

"The flip side: Type [Y] sees this and thinks [their interpretation]. Same moment, different movie."
```

### Questions that drive engagement

```
"Which type got the most defensive reading this? That's your answer."

"Type [X]s - you're quiet. Too quiet. What aren't you saying?"

"Who recognized themselves and immediately started arguing with the screen?"
```

---

## Handling Criticism

### Aggressive criticism

```
The Enneagram isn't for everyone.

Some people prefer not knowing why they keep making the same choices.

That's a valid life strategy.
```

### Trolls

```
[Don't engage. Block. Move on.]

If borderline:

"Sounds like this hit a nerve. That's usually where the growth is."

[Then stop responding.]
```

---

## Success Story Amplification

### When someone shares a breakthrough

```
THIS is the whole point.

"[Quote their specific breakthrough]"

That's Type [X] doing the hardest thing: [what's hard for that type].

Mind if I screenshot this? Other [X]s need to see it's possible.
```

---

## DM Templates

### Type questions

```
From what you've shared:

[Specific observation] = very Type [X]
[Other observation] = could be Type [Y]

Key question: Which fear runs your life?

[X fear] → Type X
[Y fear] → Type Y

The one that made you defensive is probably right.
```

### Collab requests

```
Love your stuff on [specific].

I write about why people keep running the same patterns (Enneagram + psychology).

Open to [specific collab idea]?

No pressure either way - just wanted to connect.
```

---

## Response Priority

1. **Vulnerable shares** - Always respond. These build loyalty.
2. **Criticism** - One response max. Don't feed trolls.
3. **Type questions** - Quick wins for engagement.
4. **Big accounts** - Only if you have S-tier insight.
5. **Generic agreement** - Don't just say "so true!"

---

## Timing

- **First 15 min:** Controversial takes (ride the wave)
- **Within 1 hour:** Vulnerable shares, questions
- **Within 2 hours:** Everything else
- **Skip:** Low-value comments, obvious trolls

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Never polite agreement** - Add value or skip
2. **Specificity wins** - Generic = invisible
3. **Attack + Hug** - Roast, then reveal the wound
4. **Questions > statements** - Drive engagement
5. **One troll response max** - Then block and move

Every reply is an audition. Make them think: "Who is this person and why do they know me so well?"
