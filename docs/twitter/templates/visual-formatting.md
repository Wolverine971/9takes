## Visual Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks for Readability

```
❌ BAD: Long paragraphs that run together making it hard to read on mobile devices where most people consume content

✅ GOOD:
Long paragraphs that run together.

Making it hard to read on mobile.

Where most people consume content.
```

### Emphasis Techniques

```
**ALL CAPS for major points**
THE PATTERN THAT RUINS EVERYTHING

*Italics for internal thoughts*
*What if I'm not enough?*

"Quotes for dialogue or key phrases"
She said: "I give up"

→ Arrows for progression
Fear → Behavior → Result

• Bullets for lists
• Clean
• Scannable
• Organized
```

### Number Formats

```
Statistics:
87% of Type 2s do this
3 out of 4 Type 8s agree
10,000+ hours of observation

Lists:
1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point

Or:

→ First point
→ Second point
→ Third point
```

2/5 🔴 THE PUSHER (Type 2)
→ Gives too much too fast
→ Creates dependency
→ Burns out and blames

3/5 🔵 THE GHOSTER (Type 5)
→ Withdraws when close
→ Needs "space" constantly
→ Disappears emotionally

4/5 🟡 THE PERFORMER (Type 3)
→ Shows achievement not vulnerability
→ Curates instead of connects
→ Partners feel like audience

5/5 🟢 THE TESTER (Type 6)
→ Creates scenarios to test loyalty
→ Pushes until partner fails
→ Says "I knew I couldn't trust"

Which pattern do you run? 👇
```

### Story with Visual Rhythm

```
1/ She ghosted me after 3 dates.

Perfect dates.
Great chemistry.
Then... nothing.

2/ I spent weeks analyzing:

What did I say?
What did I do?
What's wrong with me?

3/ Then I learned about Type 4 patterns.

The fear: Being ordinary
The wound: Not being seen
The defense: Reject first

4/ She didn't ghost because of me.

She ghosted because intimacy meant being seen.
And being seen meant possibly being ordinary.
And ordinary meant death to a Type 4.

5/ Now I understand:

Ghosting = Their pattern
Not my worth

Their wound
Not my failure

6/ Your type shapes how you leave.
And why it hurts.

But it's never really about you.
```

```

Type 2 → Fear: Being unloved → Defense: Giving
Type 3 → Fear: Being worthless → Defense: Achieving
Type 4 → Fear: Being ordinary → Defense: Uniqueness
```

### Before/After Format

```
BEFORE knowing your type:
"Why do I always do this?"

AFTER knowing your type:
"Oh, that's my Type 7 avoiding pain"

BEFORE: Confusion
AFTER: Choice
```

### The Matrix Format

```
        Low Energy  |  High Energy
     ________________|________________
Safe  |    Type 9    |    Type 7     |
     |______________|_______________|
Risk  |    Type 5    |    Type 8     |
     |______________|_______________|

## CTA Templates

### Soft CTAs (Higher Engagement)

```
"What pattern do you keep running?"

"Which type sounds most like you?"

"Anyone else relate to this?"

"What's your experience with [topic]?"

"Drop a ❤️ if this hit home"
```

### Link CTAs (Use Sparingly)

```
"Full breakdown of all 9 types here: [link]"

"Want to find your type? Start here: [link]"

"I went deeper on this pattern: [link]"

"If this helped, you'll love: [link]"
```

### Thread-Building CTAs

```
"Should I do a thread on Type [X] next?"

"Want me to break down [topic]?"

"Reply with your type and I'll tell you [specific thing]"

"What other patterns should we explore?"
```

## Platform-Specific Formatting

### Twitter/X Limits

- 280 characters per tweet
- Threads up to 25 tweets (stick to 3-10)
- 4 images per tweet max
- 1 link per tweet recommended

### Readability Rules

1. **One idea per tweet** in threads
2. **Break at natural pauses** for flow
3. **Use line breaks** every 2-3 lines
4. **Start tweets with numbers** (2/, 3/, etc)
5. **End strong** - each tweet should stand alone

### Algorithm Optimization

- No links in Tweet 1 (kills reach)
- Ask questions (3x more engagement)
- Use native features (polls, etc)
- Reply to yourself to boost
- Quote tweet yourself next day
