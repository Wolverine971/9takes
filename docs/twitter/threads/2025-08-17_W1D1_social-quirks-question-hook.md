## Thread Breakdown

### Main Post (Tweet 1/1)

```
What's the weirdest thing you do in social situations that you think nobody notices?

I'll go first: I size people up and actively try to be chill and nice.

I'm thinking through if I had to fight this person how would I win. I play out the whole fight in my mind - what they might do, reading their body language to see what kind of fight I'd be in for. And this goes for almost all males. Even males who are bigger than me.

It's kinda like the speak softly carry a big stick mentality. Or that General Mattis quote about having a plan to kill everyone you meet.

The other thing is I know I can be intense and I know I can scare people off with my intensity. So I actively try to match people's vibes or at least be chill and approachable.

But when I get a whiff that someone is a bit wild? My eyes light up and a voice in my head says "one of us" as I grin to myself.

My wife does something similar but different - she vibes people out to see who's funny. If someone's not funny she'll be her normal self-deprecating funny. But if someone is legit her kind of funny? She lets her guard down completely.

Same game, different currency.

(Your turn - what's your social quirk?)
