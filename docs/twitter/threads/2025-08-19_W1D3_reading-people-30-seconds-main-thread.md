## Thread Breakdown

### Tweet 1/7 (Hook)

```
I've studied 1000+ social interactions and found something wild:

Everyone gives away their personality type in the first 30 seconds.

Here are 3 signs you're probably missing:

ðŸ§µ
```

### Tweet 2/7 (Type 1 - The Perfectionist)

```
The Perfectionist Test:

Watch their eyes when you make a small mistake.

If they physically tense or their jaw clenches slightly - you've found a Type 1.

They can't help it. Imperfection causes them physical discomfort.
```

### Tweet 3/7 (Type 2 - The Helper)

```
The Helper Test:

Mention any small problem.
"Traffic was awful" or "Coffee machine broke"

If they immediately offer solutions or help - Type 2.

They're not being nice. They're earning love through service.
```

### Tweet 4/7 (Type 3 - The Achiever)

```
The Achiever Test:

Count how long before they mention work or achievements.

Under 60 seconds? Type 3.

They're not bragging. They literally believe they ARE their accomplishments.
```

### Tweet 5/7 (Type 4 - The Individualist)

```
The Individualist Test:

Look for the one unique accessory or style choice.

If they physically recoil at small talk - Type 4.

They're not rude. Ordinary conversation feels like death to them.
```

### Tweet 6/7 (Type 5 - The Investigator)

```
The Investigator Test:

Notice who's in the corner observing.

Minimal eye contact + maximum awareness = Type 5.

They're not antisocial. They're conserving energy for what matters.
```

### Tweet 7/7 (Close + Engagement)

```
Once you see these patterns, every conversation becomes fascinating.

You stop taking things personally.
You understand what people actually need.
You connect instantly.

What patterns do you notice in people?
```

## Planned Follow-up Reply (1 hour later)

```
The responses to this are incredible.

Type 6s are asking "but how do we KNOW for sure?" ðŸ˜…

That's literally the most Type 6 response possible.

(Your skepticism is your superpower btw)
```

## Expected Responses & Engagement Strategy

### Likely Type Responses:

- **Type 1s**: "This is so accurate it's scary"
- **Type 2s**: Offering to help others figure out their type
- **Type 3s**: Sharing their own achievements while commenting
- **Type 4s**: "Finally someone who gets it"
- **Type 5s**: Silent likes or detailed analytical responses
- **Type 6s**: "But how do we know for sure?" / skeptical questions
- **Type 7s**: "Now do the other types!"
- **Type 8s**: "I do this too" / relating to sizing people up
- **Type 9s**: Lurking/reading but not commenting much

### Reply Strategy:

- Type every response that shows clear patterns
- Ask "what resonates more: [fear X] or [fear Y]?" for mistypes
- Share mini-insights about other types when asked
