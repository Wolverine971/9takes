(Reply with your type and I'll explain your pattern)
```

## Midday Engagement (12 PM EST) - Reply to Big Accounts

Target accounts to engage today:

- @TherapyForBlackGirls (if they post about relationships)
- @PsychologyToday (if they share research)
- @DrJulieSmith (if she posts about emotional patterns)

Sample reply templates:

For relationship posts:
"This connects to how different personality types express love - Type 2s give through acts of service, Type 3s through achievements, Type 4s through emotional depth. The mismatch causes so much unnecessary conflict."

For psychology posts:
"Love seeing research on this! It aligns with personality patterns where body-centered types (8,9,1) need physical grounding, heart types (2,3,4) need emotional validation, and head types (5,6,7) need mental understanding."

## Afternoon Thread (3 PM EST) - Mini Value Thread

```
Love languages aren't about what you want to receive.

They're about how you naturally give love.

Type 2s cook meals = love
Type 3s achieve for you = love
Type 5s share knowledge = love
Type 8s protect you = love

What does your "giving" pattern reveal about your personality?

## Evening Engagement (6 PM EST) - Respond to Hook Comments

Go back to morning post and respond to everyone who engaged:

For "Words of Affirmation":
"Words people often need verbal reassurance because their inner critic is so loud (especially Type 1s and 3s). They're not needy - they're fighting an internal battle you can't see."

For "Acts of Service":
"Acts of Service people show love by lightening your load. Usually Type 1s (making things perfect) or Type 2s (anticipating needs). They feel most loved when someone does the same."

For "Quality Time":
"Quality Time isn't just presence - it's undivided attention. Common in Type 4s who need deep connection and Type 6s who need consistency to feel secure."

For "Physical Touch":
"Physical Touch people (often Type 7s and 8s) process emotions through their body. Touch literally regulates their nervous system. Without it, they feel disconnected from reality."

For "Gifts":
"Gift people aren't materialistic - they're symbolic thinkers. The gift represents 'you thought of me when I wasn't there.' Often Type 4s who need tangible proof they matter."
