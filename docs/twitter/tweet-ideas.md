This connects to childhood wounds that never healed.
You developed coping skills around anger, fear, or shame. But you have an underdeveloped relationship with one of them.
That's your emotional foundation. That's what makes you... you.

Real example:
She seems "difficult"? Check her emotional foundation.
Type 1 (suppressed anger): Needs things done right
Type 6 (fear-driven): Needs reassurance, not pushback
Type 3 (hidden shame): Needs to maintain image
Adjust your approach accordingly.
5/6
The secret sauce: Give your take BEFORE seeing others.
Most platforms show you everyone's opinion firstâ€”instant groupthink.
Comment first, then see all 9 perspectives. Your authentic read matters.
6/6
Small experiment:
Next difficult person you encounterâ€”guess their core emotion first (anger/fear/shame).
Then respond to the emotion, not the behavior.
