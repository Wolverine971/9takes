_Topic: Neurodiversity + Mental Health_

## Question Hooks (Mondays)

### Hook 1: ADHD & Personality

```
ADHD + personality type = your unique brain wiring.

Which combo describes you?

ðŸ”¸ ADHD + Perfectionist (hyperfocus on details)
ðŸ”¸ ADHD + Helper (forgetting self while helping others)
ðŸ”¸ ADHD + Achiever (productivity anxiety spiral)
ðŸ”¸ ADHD + Creative (rejection sensitive dysphoria)
ðŸ”¸ Other combo in comments ðŸ‘‡

Same ADHD. Different experience.
```

### Hook 2: Masking Patterns

```
Autism masking looks different for everyone.

What's your masking pattern?

ðŸ”¸ Perfectionist masking (over-preparing for social situations)
ðŸ”¸ Helper masking (focusing on others' needs)
ðŸ”¸ Achiever masking (performing "success" to fit in)
ðŸ”¸ Creative masking (hiding behind artistic persona)

Your personality shapes how you mask.
```

### Hook 3: Anxiety Manifestations

```
Anxiety hits different based on your personality:

Type 1: "Everything must be perfect or it's wrong"
Type 2: "Everyone needs something from me right now"
Type 3: "I'm falling behind everyone else"
Type 4: "No one understands how I feel"
Type 5: "This is too much stimulation"

Which anxiety pattern is yours?
```

## Value Threads (Wednesdays)

### Thread 1: ADHD Patterns by Personality Type

```
1/9 ADHD isn't one-size-fits-all.

Your personality type shapes how ADHD shows up in your life.

Same brain difference. Nine different experiences:

2/9 TYPE 1 + ADHD: The Perfectionist's Paradox

Hyperfocus: Organizing, improving, correcting details
Struggles: Nothing feels "good enough" to start
Internal dialogue: "If I can't do it perfectly, why start?"

Executive dysfunction feels like moral failure.

3/9 TYPE 2 + ADHD: The Helper's Burnout

Hyperfocus: Other people's needs and problems
Struggles: Forgetting to eat, sleep, or care for themselves
Internal dialogue: "Everyone else comes first"

They'll organize your life while theirs falls apart.

4/9 TYPE 3 + ADHD: The Achiever's Anxiety

Hyperfocus: Productivity systems, optimization, goals
Struggles: Paralyzed by fear of looking unsuccessful
Internal dialogue: "I must appear to have it all together"

They research 47 productivity methods but use none.

5/9 TYPE 4 + ADHD: The Creative's Emotional Rollercoaster

Hyperfocus: Art, emotions, deep meaning-making
Struggles: Rejection sensitive dysphoria hits harder
Internal dialogue: "I'm too much and not enough simultaneously"

Their ADHD feels like proof they're fundamentally different.

6/9 TYPE 5 + ADHD: The Investigator's Information Hoarding

Hyperfocus: Learning, researching, understanding systems
Struggles: Social exhaustion from masking
Internal dialogue: "I need to understand everything before I act"

They become experts on ADHD but avoid treatment.

7/9 TYPE 6 + ADHD: The Loyalist's Catastrophic Thinking

Hyperfocus: Worst-case scenario planning, safety research
Struggles: Decision paralysis from too many "what-ifs"
Internal dialogue: "What could go wrong with this medication/strategy?"

They research every possible side effect for hours.

8/9 TYPE 7-9 patterns:

Type 7: Hyperfocus on new interests, struggle with routine maintenance
Type 8: Hyperfocus on control/power, struggle with authority figures
Type 9: Hyperfocus on others' needs, struggle with self-advocacy

Same ADHD medication. Different results.

9/9 The game-changer:

ADHD treatment that considers personality type.

Type 1 needs: Structure that allows for flexibility
Type 2 needs: Permission to focus on themselves
Type 3 needs: Systems that look successful to others

One diagnosis. Nine different support approaches.

What's your ADHD + type combo?
```

### Thread 2: Mental Health Stigma by Personality Type

```
1/8 Mental health stigma hits different based on your personality type.

Same diagnosis. Different shame:

2/8 TYPE 1: "I should be able to fix this myself"

Perfectionist shame: Mental illness = personal failure
Biggest barrier: Admitting they can't control their brain chemistry
Treatment resistance: "Therapy means I'm broken"

They research symptoms but won't get diagnosed.

3/8 TYPE 2: "I can't burden others with my problems"

Helper guilt: Others need help more than I do
Biggest barrier: Prioritizing everyone else's mental health first
Treatment resistance: "I should be helping, not getting help"

They become mental health advocates for others while suffering alone.

4/8 TYPE 3: "This will ruin my image"

Achiever shame: Mental illness = weakness/failure
Biggest barrier: Fear of professional/social consequences
Treatment resistance: "What if people find out?"

They high-function through breakdowns to maintain image.

5/8 TYPE 4: "This proves I'm fundamentally flawed"

Individualist despair: Mental illness = confirmation of brokenness
Biggest barrier: Romanticizing suffering as part of identity
Treatment resistance: "What if I'm boring without my pain?"

They fear healing will erase their uniqueness.

6/8 TYPE 5: "I don't want to be seen as needy"

Investigator withdrawal: Mental illness = loss of independence
Biggest barrier: Fear of being too much for others
Treatment resistance: "I should figure this out myself"

They research every treatment but avoid human connection.

7/8 TYPE 6: "What if the treatment makes things worse?"

Loyalist anxiety: Mental illness = loss of security/control
Biggest barrier: Fear of medication/therapy side effects
Treatment resistance: "But what if...?"

They want help but catastrophize every treatment option.

8/8 TYPE 7-9 barriers:

Type 7: "This is too heavy, let's focus on positive things"
Type 8: "Therapy is for weak people" (vulnerability = weakness)
Type 9: "I don't want to be a burden" (conflict avoidance)

The breakthrough: Personality-informed mental health care.

What barrier does your type need to overcome?

### Thread 3: Autism Masking by Personality Type

```
1/7 Autism masking looks different for every personality type.

Same goal (fitting in). Different strategies:

2/7 TYPE 1 (Perfectionist) Masking:
- Over-prepares for every social interaction
- Scripts conversations in advance
- Follows social rules rigidly
- Internal stress: "Am I doing this correctly?"

Masking exhaustion: Perfectionist burnout from social "performance"

3/7 TYPE 2 (Helper) Masking:
- Focuses entirely on others' needs to avoid self-focus
- Becomes hyper-attuned to others' emotions
- Uses helping as social camouflage
- Internal stress: "If I'm useful, they'll accept me"

Masking exhaustion: Gives everything, receives nothing

4/7 TYPE 3 (Achiever) Masking:
- Performs neurotypical success markers
- Hides stims/special interests that seem "unsuccessful"
- Uses achievements to deflect from social struggles
- Internal stress: "I must appear competent and normal"

Masking exhaustion: Imposter syndrome in their own life

5/7 TYPE 4 (Individualist) Masking:
- Reframes autism as "artistic temperament"
- Uses creative expression to communicate indirectly
- Hides in plain sight through "quirky" persona
- Internal stress: "Am I authentically unique or just different?"

Masking exhaustion: Identity confusion between self and mask

6/7 TYPE 5 (Investigator) Masking:
- Studies social interactions like research subjects
- Minimizes social contact to reduce masking demands
- Uses knowledge/expertise to avoid small talk
- Internal stress: "I'm observing life instead of living it"

Masking exhaustion: Complete social withdrawal

7/7 TYPE 6-9 masking patterns:

Type 6: Seeks group belonging through careful rule-following
Type 7: Uses humor/entertainment to deflect from differences
Type 8: Controls environments to minimize masking needs
Type 9: Camouflages through extreme agreeableness

The cost: Masking prevents authentic connection.

What does masking look like for your type?

## Daily Engagement Responses

### When someone shares ADHD struggles:

```
ADHD + Type [X] is such a specific experience.

That [struggle] makes total sense for your type - [specific validation based on type patterns].

Have you found any strategies that work with your personality instead of against it?
```

### When someone disagrees about neurodiversity:

```
You're right that neurodiversity experiences are individual.

What factors do you think shape how conditions like ADHD/autism show up differently in people?

Always learning from different perspectives.
```

### When someone asks for resources:

```
Based on Type [X] + [condition], you might benefit from [specific approach].

The key is finding support that works WITH your personality's natural patterns.

Here are some [type-specific] resources: [relevant suggestions]
```

## Community Building

### Vulnerability Share:

```
Personal share:

As a Type [X] with [condition], I spent years thinking I was "broken."

Turns out I was just trying to fit into systems designed for different brains.

When I learned to work WITH my [personality + neurodiversity], everything changed.

Instead of fighting my [specific pattern], I designed my life around it.

Game changer.

What would change if you stopped trying to be a different kind of brain?
```

### Success Story:

```
Update from the ADHD thread:

"I'm Type 5 with ADHD. Started using the 'energy management' approach instead of time management.

Now I work with my hyperfocus cycles instead of against them.

First time in years I feel like my brain is working FOR me."

Small shifts that honor your neurodiversity = huge life improvements.

What tiny change made a big difference for you?
