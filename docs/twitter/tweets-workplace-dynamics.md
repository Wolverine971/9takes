_Phase 1: Foundation & Discoverability_
_Topic: Productivity + Professional Communication_

## Question Hooks (Mondays)

### Hook 1: Meeting Behavior

```
Your meeting behavior reveals your personality type.

Which describes you?

ðŸ”¸ "Actually, the correct information is..." (facts first)
ðŸ”¸ "How can I help make this happen?" (service oriented)
ðŸ”¸ "What's our timeline and deliverables?" (results focused)
ðŸ”¸ "Has anyone considered this angle?" (unique perspective)
ðŸ”¸ "I need to think about this more" (processing time)

Your default meeting persona is on autopilot.
```

### Hook 2: Procrastination Patterns

```
Why do you procrastinate?

ðŸ”¸ "It has to be perfect first" (perfectionist paralysis)
ðŸ”¸ "Let me help everyone else first" (others before self)
ðŸ”¸ "I'll do it when I can do it impressively" (image management)
ðŸ”¸ "I'm not feeling inspired right now" (mood-dependent)
ðŸ”¸ "I need more information" (analysis paralysis)

Your procrastination has a hidden purpose.
```

### Hook 3: Productivity Systems

```
What productivity system works for you?

ðŸ”¸ Detailed calendars and checklists (structure lovers)
ðŸ”¸ Flexible time blocks (freedom within framework)
ðŸ”¸ Sprint-based work sessions (intensity then rest)
ðŸ”¸ Follow-your-energy approach (work with natural rhythms)
ðŸ”¸ None - productivity advice stresses me out

Your brain needs different systems than others.
```

### Thread 3: Procrastination Patterns by Personality Type

```
1/8 Procrastination looks different for every personality type.

Same deadline. Different avoidance strategy:

2/8 TYPE 1: Perfectionist Paralysis

Pattern: "I can't start until I know I can do it perfectly"
Avoidance: Research, planning, organizing everything except the actual task
Internal dialogue: "If I can't do it right, I shouldn't do it at all"
Solution: Set "good enough" standards and deadlines for perfection

They'd rather not start than start imperfectly.

3/8 TYPE 2: People-First Procrastination

Pattern: "Let me help everyone else first, then I'll do my work"
Avoidance: Answering others' requests, solving others' problems
Internal dialogue: "Their needs are more important than my tasks"
Solution: Schedule self-tasks like appointments with others

They'll organize everyone else's life while theirs falls apart.

4/8 TYPE 3: Image Management Delays

Pattern: "I'll do it when I can do it impressively"
Avoidance: Waiting for the perfect moment to showcase competence
Internal dialogue: "This needs to make me look successful"
Solution: Set private practice deadlines before public deadlines

They'd rather be late than look anything less than amazing.

5/8 TYPE 4: Mood-Dependent Delays

Pattern: "I'm not feeling inspired to work on this right now"
Avoidance: Waiting for the right emotional state or creative flow
Internal dialogue: "Mundane work kills my soul"
Solution: Link routine tasks to deeper meaning/values

They need emotional connection to every task.

6/8 TYPE 5: Analysis Paralysis

Pattern: "I need more information before I can begin"
Avoidance: Research, learning, understanding every angle first
Internal dialogue: "I don't know enough yet to do this well"
Solution: Set research deadlines and "good enough" knowledge thresholds

They'll become experts on the task instead of doing it.

7/8 TYPE 6: Anxiety Avoidance

Pattern: "What if I do this wrong? Let me think about it more"
Avoidance: Seeking reassurance, checking with others, worst-case planning
Internal dialogue: "I need to be 100% certain before I act"
Solution: Break tasks into smaller, lower-risk pieces

They'll plan for every contingency except actually starting.

8/8 TYPE 7-9 procrastination patterns:

Type 7: "This is boring, let me do something more interesting first"
Type 8: "I don't want to do this, so I'll control everything else instead"
Type 9: "I'll get to it eventually, it's not urgent yet"

Your procrastination pattern is your personality's protection mechanism.
