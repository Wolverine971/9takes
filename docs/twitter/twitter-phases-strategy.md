## Current Status: Phase 1 (Foundation & Discoverability)

**Start Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Current Followers:** 28  
**Phase Goal:** 200 followers by September 22, 2025

### Phase 1 Strategy

**Core Principle:** Cast a wide net with tangential content that attracts people interested in personality, psychology, relationships, and self-development without requiring Enneagram knowledge.

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Tangential topics (love languages, neurodiversity, mental health)
- 30% Social dynamics (conflict resolution, Reddit culture, social media)
- 20% Light Enneagram content (accessible to newcomers)
- 10% 9takes platform teasers

### Tangential Topics Strategy

These topics attract users who might be interested in Enneagram/9takes but don't know it yet:

**Direct Psychology Connection:**
- Love Languages (301k searches/month)
- Neurodiversity (ADHD, autism, etc.)
- Mental health patterns
- Attachment styles
- Communication styles

**Social Dynamics Connection:**
- Reddit culture and psychology
- Social media's effects on relationships
- Conflict resolution patterns
- Dating and relationship dynamics
- Workplace personality conflicts

**Self-Development Connection:**
- Productivity styles by personality
- Decision-making patterns
- Stress responses
- Goal-setting approaches
- Habit formation by type
