## Post 2: Shadow Content - Self-Sabotage (THREAD - 6 tweets)

**Format:** Thread
**Status:** Ready to post

```
1/6
You're smart. You work hard.

So why do you keep hitting the same wall?

Your personality type has a self-sabotage pattern. 🧵

2/6
Type 1: Perfection paralysis
Type 2: Give until you're empty, resent everyone
Type 3: Work until you crash

3/6
Type 4: Compare yourself until you quit
Type 5: Research forever, act never
Type 6: Prepare for disaster, never start

4/6
Type 7: Start everything, finish nothing
Type 8: Burn bridges before they can leave
Type 9: Numb out and avoid

5/6
The pattern isn't random.

It started in childhood.
It felt like protection.
Now it's holding you back.

6/6
You can't fix what you can't see.

## Post 3: Mental Health - Overthinking (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
"Just stop overthinking."

Thanks. I'll just turn off the thought loop that's been running since I was 7.

Type 1: "Did I do the right thing?" (on repeat for 72 hours)
Type 6: "What could go wrong?" (answer: everything, always)
Type 4: "Why did I feel that?" (and what does it mean about my soul)

The loop isn't a choice. It's a wound.

## Post 4: Quick Insight - Type 6 (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
Type 6s asking for reassurance for the 47th time today:

The reassurance isn't working because you're not actually afraid of the thing.

You're afraid of trusting your own judgment.

No amount of "you'll be fine" fixes that.

Only action does. Move before you're ready.

## Post 5: Shadow Content - Manipulation (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
Type 2 manipulation sounds like:

"After everything I've done for you..."
"I'm not mad, just disappointed."

It's not evil. It's protection learned young.

But recognizing it is the first step.

## Post 6: Relationship Red Flag (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
Red flag you're dating a Type 8:

They test your loyalty by starting fights.

It's not aggression. It's "are you strong enough to stay?"

Pass the test by standing your ground calmly.
```

## Post 7: One Situation - Promotion (THREAD - 5 tweets)

**Format:** Thread
**Status:** Ready to post

9 types. 9 internal responses. 🧵

2/5
Type 1: "This is unfair. I deserved it."
Type 2: "I gave everything for this?"
Type 3: "What did they have that I don't?"

3/5
Type 4: "Of course. I'm never recognized."
Type 5: "Politics. Knew it wasn't merit-based."
Type 6: "Did someone say something about me?"

4/5
Type 7: "Their loss. Something better will come."
Type 8: "Time to have a direct conversation."
Type 9: "Maybe it's fine. Less stress anyway."

```

**Poll options:**

- Get critical and rigid

## Post 9: Uncomfortable Truth (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
Type 5s don't ghost you because they're rude.

They ghost you because your emotional needs feel like a vampire sucking their life force.

Every "how are you feeling?" = energy debt.
Every "we need to talk" = existential threat.

It's not personal. It's survival math.

(Still rude though.)

## Post 10: Dating Pattern (SINGLE TWEET)

**Format:** Single tweet
**Status:** Ready to post

```
Why Type 2s and Type 8s keep finding each other:

2 wants to be needed.
8 needs someone who won't leave.

Looks like chemistry.
Actually trauma bonding.

## Post 11: MBTI Bridge - INTJ Roast (QUOTE TWEET)

**Format:** Quote tweet (find viral INTJ post first)
**Status:** Ready - find target tweet
**Target:** Any "INTJ master planner" or "INTJs are built different" post with 5k+ likes

```
INTJ is a costume.

Half of you are disintegrated 5s hoarding knowledge like a dragon on Red Bull.

The other half are 8s who took the test when angry.

"Master strategist" = "I have 47 contingency plans and zero follow-through."

MBTI is the resume. Enneagram is the therapy session.

## Post 12: MBTI Bridge - INFJ Door Slam (QUOTE TWEET)

**Format:** Quote tweet
**Status:** Ready - find target tweet
**Target:** Any "INFJ door slam" meme with high engagement

```
INFJs door-slam like it's a mic drop.

But let's be honest:

As an Enneagram 9, you're just numbing out conflict you invented.
As a 4, you're making an exit more dramatic than the actual offense.

Either way, you're running from something you haven't named yet.

MBTI tells you what. Enneagram tells you why you can't stop.

## Post 13: MBTI Bridge - ENFP Chaos (QUOTE TWEET)

**Format:** Quote tweet
**Status:** Ready - find target tweet
**Target:** Any "ENFP energy" or "ENFP in therapy" post

```
ENFP is the mask.

Real question: Are you a Type 7 running from pain with sparkly distractions?

Or a Type 4 romanticizing your chaos as "being authentic"?

One of you needs more depth. The other needs to stop drowning in it.

Figure out which and your life changes.

## Post 14: Childhood Wounds (THREAD - 4 tweets) ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Format:** Thread
**Status:** Ready to post
**Note:** Grok identified this as highest viral potential

```
1/4
The sentence you heard as a child that still controls you:

🧵

2/4
Type 1: "We love you, but can you do it correctly?"
Type 2: "I don't need anything, go play."
Type 3: "Wow, look at [sibling] go!"
Type 4: "Why can't you just be normal?"
Type 5: "You're so sensitive. Toughen up."

3/4
Type 6: "You can't trust anyone but family."
Type 7: "Stop crying. Look on the bright side."
Type 8: "You have to be strong or they'll eat you alive."
Type 9: "Don't make waves. Keep the peace."

4/4
If one of these just punched you in the chest:

I'm sorry.

But now you know where the pattern started.

Reply with which one hit you.

## Post 15: MBTI→Enneagram Viral Thread ⭐ POST THIS WEEK

**Format:** Thread
**Status:** Ready to post
**When:** Tuesday or Thursday, 8 PM EST

```
1/7
MBTI is the mask you show the world.

Enneagram is the childhood wound you're still bleeding from.

Quick, brutal translation: 🧵

2/7
INTJ → Type 5 in armor
(hoarding knowledge to feel safe from a world that felt overwhelming)

ENFP → Type 7 in glitter
(running from emptiness with enthusiasm and sparkle)

3/7
INFJ → Type 4 or 9 in costume
(dramatic withdrawal OR numbed-out peacekeeping)

INTP → Type 5 or 6
(analysis as protection, doubt as a loyalty test)

4/7
ENTJ → Type 8 in a suit
(control as defense against betrayal)

ISFJ → Type 2 in disguise
(giving as currency for love)

5/7
ESTP → Type 7 or 8
(action to avoid feeling, intensity to avoid vulnerability)

ENFJ → Type 2 or 3
(performance as love language)

6/7
MBTI tells you what you do.
Enneagram tells you why you can't stop.

One is a personality description.
The other is a wound autopsy.

7/7
If one of these translations just hit different:

I'm sorry but also you're welcome.

Full breakdown: 9takes.com

RT if someone needs to see their mask slip.
