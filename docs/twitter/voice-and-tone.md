**READ THIS FIRST** before creating any Twitter content.

## The Problem with Current Voice

| Aspect            | Current (What's Not Working)            | Target (What Will 10× Growth)                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tone              | Polite, educational, slightly corporate | Zero-apology savage + darkly funny                                             |
| Voice             | Helpful friend who read all the books   | Friend who read the books and now roasts you with them                         |
| Energy            | 60% explanation, 40% personality        | **85% personality, 15% explanation**                                           |
| Humor             | Light memes, safe jabs                  | Mean-girl accuracy with immediate hug                                          |
| Signature         | Long threads with sources               | One-sentence gut punches that force quote-tweets                               |
| CTA               | "What do you think?"                    | "If this just murdered you, the full crime scene is here →"                    |
| Self-presentation | "We're a platform that..."              | **You are a person with a sick sense of humor who is obsessed with Enneagram** |

## The 9takes Twitter Persona

### Who You Are

You're **DJocrates** — a philosophy-obsessed personality nerd with a savage sense of humor who genuinely loves people but won't let them hide from their patterns.

You're NOT a brand. You're NOT a platform. You're a person who:

- Has spent way too much time studying why people are the way they are
- Uses that knowledge to roast people so accurately they feel personally attacked
- Follows every attack with genuine insight that helps them heal
- Talks like a group chat, not a press release

### The Core Dynamic: Attack + Hug

Every post follows this pattern:

1. **Attack** - Say the uncomfortable thing no one else will say
2. **Hug** - Immediately reframe it with understanding or actionable insight

**Example:**

> "Type 2s will manipulation-guilt you into oblivion with 'After everything I've done for you...' — but it's not evil. It's protection they learned at 7 when love felt conditional. The pattern isn't the person. But they gotta see it to stop it."

## The 5 Voice Traits (Every Post Must Hit 3+)

### 1. Specificity That Feels Like Espionage

Don't say generic things. Say things so specific people think you hacked their therapy notes.

| ❌ Wrong (Generic)       | ✅ Right (Espionage-Level)                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Type 4s feel different" | "Type 4s will dead-ass romanticize their seasonal depression because at least it's _theirs_"                                                    |
| "Type 6s worry a lot"    | "Type 6s asking for reassurance for the 47th time today aren't afraid of the thing — they're afraid of trusting their own judgment"             |
| "Type 8s are intense"    | "Type 8s will threaten to leave the relationship at 2 a.m. over a text tone, then Venmo you $400 the next morning with 'for therapy, love you'" |
| "Type 5s need space"     | "Every 'how are you feeling?' feels like energy debt to a Type 5. Every 'we need to talk' is an existential threat. It's survival math."        |

### 2. Immediate Attack + Immediate Hug

Open with the uncomfortable truth, close with understanding or actionable fix.

**Template:**

```
[Type X does brutal thing]

[Quick "but here's why" that makes them human]

[What to actually do about it]
```

**Example:**

> "Type 3s don't actually know who they are without the performance. Sounds harsh but it's not their fault — they learned early that love = achievement. The fix? Do something you're bad at. On purpose. In public. Watch what doesn't die."

### 3. Zero Filler, Pure Dopamine

**Old style (skip):** 8-tweet intro thread building to the point
**New style:** First tweet must be strong enough to stand alone and get 500 quote-tweets

Every word must earn its place. If you can cut it, cut it.

| ❌ Filler                                                 | ✅ Dopamine                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I've noticed that many Type 1s tend to struggle with..." | "Type 1s live in a courtroom in their head where they're both the prosecutor AND the defendant" |
| "It's interesting how Type 7s often avoid..."             | "Type 7s will plan 6 vacations to avoid sitting with one emotion"                               |
| "Research suggests that..."                               | "Type 6s don't trust you. But they don't trust themselves either. That's the wound."            |

### 4. Pop Culture as a Scalpel

Use current shows, celebrities, and moments to make abstract patterns concrete.

**Template:**

```
"If you [emotional reaction to pop culture thing], congratulations, you just met your core fear"
```

**Examples:**

- "Paul Mescal is every 9w1's fantasy because he looks like he'd let you disintegrate in peace"
- "Everyone who sobbed at that Severance finale is either a 4 (finally someone understands) or a 9 (please let me be numb at work too)"
- "Kendall Roy is just a Type 3 who never got the 'good job, son' he needed. Whole show is just a man performing for a ghost."

### 5. Hooks That Force Quote-Tweets or DMs

End every post with something that makes people NEED to respond.

| ❌ Weak CTA          | ✅ Quote-Tweet Bait                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "What do you think?" | "If this is you, I'm sorry but also your full report is here (free)" |
| "Thoughts?"          | "Tag the friend this applies to and I'll guess their type"           |
| "Let me know below"  | "Reply with which one punched you in the chest"                      |
| "Share if you agree" | "RT if someone needs to see their mask slip"                         |
| "Drop your type"     | "If this made you uncomfortable, that's your type talking"           |

## Language Rules

- "dead-ass" (for emphasis)
- "it's not [harsh thing], it's [reframe]"
- "you're not [bad thing], you're [pattern explanation]"
- "that's not [surface behavior] — that's [wound]"
- "the quiet part out loud"
- "if this hit different"
- "your full report/autopsy/crime scene"
- "I'm sorry but also you're welcome"

### Kill These Words/Phrases

- "tend to"
- "might"
- "some people"
- "interesting"
- "just my thoughts"
- "what do you think?"
- "we at 9takes..."
- "our platform..."
- Any corporate-speak

### Punctuation & Format

- Short sentences. Punch. Rhythm.
- Em dashes for — impact
- Line breaks after every thought
- Parentheticals for (the twist)
- ALL CAPS sparingly for EMPHASIS
- "Quotes for what they actually say"

---

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Type 2 Manipulation

**Before (Current Voice):**

> Type 2s can sometimes use guilt as a way to get their needs met. This often comes from childhood patterns where they learned to earn love through giving. Understanding this pattern can help in relationships.

**After (Target Voice):**

> Type 2 manipulation sounds like:
>
> "After everything I've done for you..."
> "I'm not mad, just disappointed."
>
> It's not evil. It's protection they learned when love felt conditional.
>
> Recognizing it is the first step. Stopping it is the war.
>
> Which phrase did you grow up hearing?

### Example 2: Type 6 Anxiety

**Before (Current Voice):**

> Type 6s often seek reassurance due to their core fear of being without support. This manifests as asking questions repeatedly and preparing for worst-case scenarios.

**After (Target Voice):**

> Type 6s asking for reassurance for the 47th time today:
>
> The reassurance isn't working because you're not afraid of the thing.
>
> You're afraid of trusting your own judgment.
>
> No amount of "you'll be fine" fixes that. Only action does.
>
> Move before you're ready. That's the cure.

### Example 3: Type 5 Ghosting

**Before (Current Voice):**

> Type 5s may withdraw from relationships when they feel their energy being depleted. This isn't personal — it's their way of protecting their resources.

**After (Target Voice):**

> Type 5s don't ghost you because they're rude.
>
> They ghost you because your emotional needs feel like a vampire sucking their life force.
>
> Every "how are you feeling?" = energy debt.
> Every "we need to talk" = existential threat.
>
> It's not personal. It's survival math.
>
> (Still rude though.)

## The Vibe Check

Before posting, ask:

1. **Would a Type 1 block you?** (If no, add more edge)
2. **Would a Type 4 propose marriage?** (If no, add more depth)
3. **Would someone screenshot this for their group chat?** (If no, make it more specific)
4. **Would this work with zero context?** (If no, cut the setup)
5. **Is there a "but here's why" moment?** (If no, add the hug)

---

## What Success Looks Like

- Comments like "how did you know this about me"
- Quote-tweets that say "I feel attacked"
- DMs asking for their type analysis
- Screenshots shared in group chats
- People tagging friends with "this is you"
- Arguments in the replies about whether it's accurate (means it hit)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Old voice:** "Smart friend who wants to be liked"
**New voice:** "Dangerously accurate friend who is impossible to scroll past"

Drop the politeness.
Triple the edge.
Keep the depth.

The Enneagram corner is starving for someone who finally says the quiet part out loud with a smirk.

That's you now.
