## Quick Reference: Key Frameworks for 9takes

These are the frameworks most relevant to 9takes content strategy. Each is explained in detail in the course notes below.

### 1. Content Funnel (ToF/MoF/BoF)

**What it is:** All content serves one of three stages in the audience journey.

| Stage                      | Purpose                           | For 9takes                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Top of Funnel (ToF)**    | Attract new readers, broad appeal | "Why dating apps are harder for certain types" |
| **Middle of Funnel (MoF)** | Build trust, showcase expertise   | "How each type self-sabotages success"         |
| **Bottom of Funnel (BoF)** | Convert to action                 | Newsletter signups, product CTAs               |

**9takes gap:** Most content is MoF/BoF. Need more ToF (50% target).

### 2. Trust Onion Framework 🧅

**What it is:** Your audience places blame at different layers. Meet them where they are.

| Layer      | They Blame                              | Content Strategy                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Outer**  | Circumstances (time, money, algorithms) | Validate external struggles, quick wins |
| **Middle** | Specific people (boss, ex, parents)     | Pattern recognition, strategic advice   |
| **Inner**  | Themselves                              | Motivational, coaching content          |

**9takes gap:** Content often skips to Inner layer. New readers are at Outer layer.

→ See: [Trust Onion Framework](#trust-onion-framework-🧅)

### 3. EEO Continuum (Voice Calibration)

**What it is:** Calibrate your voice based on audience trust level.

| Voice           | Use When          | Example                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Observation** | New/cold audience | "Studies show Type 5s tend to..."  |
| **Experience**  | Warming audience  | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| **Expert**      | Trusted audience  | "Type 5s do this because..."       |

**9takes gap:** Default voice is Expert. Use more Observation/Experience for ToF content.

→ See: [EEO Continuum](#eeo-continuum)

### 4. Content Flywheel

**What it is:** High-effort content should generate low-effort content, creating momentum.

```
Blog Post (high effort) → X Thread → Standalone Tweets → Engagement → New Blog Ideas
```

**9takes application:** Every blog post should generate 5-10 social posts within 48 hours.

→ See: [Effortless Content Flywheel](#effortless-content-flywheel)

### 5. Give-to-Ask Ratio

**What it is:** Track how often you provide value vs. ask for action.

| Ratio              | Effect                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 80% give / 20% ask | **Sweet spot for growth phase** |
| <70% give          | Damages brand equity            |

→ See: [Build & Liquidate Brand Equity](#build--liquidate-brand-equity)

### 6. Repost Strategy

**What it is:** Repost your best-performing content after 4-6 weeks.

**Why:** New followers haven't seen old content. Good content is still good later.

→ See: [Repost](#repost)

### 7. Famous Person Effect Warning

**What it is:** Don't copy strategies from accounts with 1M+ followers. Study accounts 10K-50K (slightly ahead of you).

## Organic Content Funnel Ratios

- **Content Needs:** How much content you need depends on your audience and business.

### Key Points

- **Start with Short-Form Talking Head Videos:** This is the easiest and most effective way to start on social media.
- **Script Your Videos:** Writing out your script ensures high-quality content but make sure it's in a spoken style, not written.
- **Test Bullet Points vs. Full Scripts:** If you're comfortable with bullet points, use them, but if you ramble, stick to full scripts.
- **Response Videos:** These are effective but require more skill; they work well in bottom-of-funnel content.
- **Experience Matters for Podcast Clips:** You need years of experience to make unscripted podcast clips work on social media.
- **Mock Interviews:** These can be useful for creating engaging content, but they require a lot of post-production work.

## The Hook

⏱️ **Duration:** 3:24

### Key Points

> ⚠️ **Critical:** The first 5 seconds are crucial for capturing the audience's attention. If your hook is bad, it doesn't matter how good the rest of the video is.

- **Generic Hooks Fail:** Generic hooks are not tailored to your specific audience. Specificity in hooks creates a stronger response from the target audience.
- ❗ **Don't Beg:** Begging with your hook is NOT an effective long-term strategy.

## Brevity

⏱️ **Duration:** 1:58

### Key Points

- **Writing vs. Speaking Voice:** Beginners often write scripts as if they are writing a blog. This makes the video sound awkward and unnatural.
- **Conciseness:** _"Cut the fluff, keep the stuff"_ – If a script becomes too short after cutting, reconsider if the content is worth making a video at all.

#### Time to Value & Value to Time:

| Metric               | Goal                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time to Value** 📉 | The time it takes to get to the value must be LOW           |
| **Value to Time** 📈 | The value provided for the time spent watching must be HIGH |

### Tips for Effective Scriptwriting

- ✅ Explain the topic in the first 5 seconds
- ✅ Identify and retain only necessary words
- ✅ Know your audience and cut out any implications
- ✅ Aim for viewers to want to watch the video more than once
- ✅ Avoid cheap shots and stay respectful

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lighting > Expensive Cameras**   | Good lighting makes a bigger difference than an expensive camera. Even a phone can look professional with proper lighting.   |
| **Use Cinematic Mode**             | Set your phone to cinematic mode, adjust aperture to ~5.6 for natural background blur.                                       |
| **Record in 4K, 30fps**            | Switch to 4K resolution and set frame rate to 30fps — ideal settings for social media content.                               |
| **Tripod Placement Matters**       | Use a tripod off your desk to prevent camera shake when you move around.                                                     |
| **Wireless Mics Are Great**        | Use wireless mics close to your mouth for better audio; placement on a collar, hat, or shirt works well.                     |
| **Bluetooth Screen Helps Framing** | Use a Bluetooth screen to mirror your display and stay perfectly framed while recording with the back camera.                |
| **Start Simple**                   | You don't need a full studio or expensive gear to get millions of views — your phone and a few smart accessories are enough. |
