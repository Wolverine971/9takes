# Who Might Actually Read These Profiles (and Who Might Forward Them)

Based on the _published_ people profiles in `src/blog/people/drafts/` (`published: true`) as of 2026-01-26.

How to read this:

- **Self-read** = if the subject encounters the link (Googles themselves, gets tagged, gets texted), do they click + skim?
- **Forwarders** = who would realistically send the link to the subject (group chats, staff, collaborators).
- **Natural readers** = who will read even if the subject never does.

Big patterns I see across the writing:

- These are longform psych explainers with a built-in hook (often controversy + vulnerability). That means **fans + media people** are the default audience.
- The people most likely to self-read are **creators/founders** (reputation is a dashboard) and **Type 4/5/6-ish introspective/anxious personalities**.
- The fastest path to the subject is rarely SEO. It's usually **a group chat**: writers/comics, producers, podcasters, campaign staffers, or an adjacent creator orbit.
