_Purpose: Step-by-step process for creating high-quality blog content_

## Overview

This document provides the complete workflow for creating, editing, and optimizing blog content for 9takes. Follow this process for consistent, high-quality output.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Planning

### Before You Write

**Goal:** Align the idea, audience, and CTA before drafting.

#### Quick Planning Template

Fill this out for every piece:

- **Title:** [SEO-optimized, compelling]
- **Target Keyword:** [Primary search term]
- **Search Volume:** [Monthly searches]
- **Audience:** [Specific segment]
- **Job to be Done:** [What problem are they solving?]
- **Promise:** "After reading this, you'll be able to..."
- **Primary CTA:** [One clear action]
- **Content Angle:** [What's unique/contrarian?]
- **Proof Sources:** [Data, examples, case studies]
- **Success Metric:** [How we measure success]
- **Internal Links:** [3-5 related posts]

### Content Type Decision Tree

```
Is it filling a critical gap? → Priority 1
├── Yes + High search volume → IMMEDIATE
├── Yes + Low search volume → This week
└── No → Check other factors
    ├── Monetization potential? → Priority 2
    ├── Authority building? → Priority 3
    └── Community value? → Priority 4
```

## Phase 2: Structure First (McPhee Method)

### The Invisible Architecture

**Goal:** Make the structure strong but invisible to readers.

#### Structural Options

Choose based on content type:

1. **Problem → Cause → Solution** (Most common)
   - Open with relatable problem
   - Explore root causes
   - Provide actionable solutions

2. **Chronological Journey**
   - Past state → Present challenge → Future solution
   - Good for transformation content

3. **Type-by-Type Analysis** (Enneagram standard)
   - Introduction to concept
   - Type 1 through Type 9
   - Synthesis and conclusion

4. **Question & Answer**
   - Series of related questions
   - Deep answers with examples
   - Natural FAQ format

### Beat Outline Template

```markdown

3. **Psychological Insight** - "Here's why..."
4. **Type-Specific Application** - "For Type X..."
5. **Practical Tools** - Scripts, frameworks, exercises
6. **Clear Next Step** - Specific action

## Phase 4: Two-Pass Editing System

### Pass 1: Macro Edit (Structure)

**Focus:** Big picture coherence

- [ ] Does the lead deliver the promise?
- [ ] Is there a clear through-line?

- [ ] Does it resolve the tension?

**Actions:**

- Reorder sections if needed
- Merge redundant parts
- Split complex sections
- Add missing beats
- Strengthen transitions

### Pass 2: Micro Edit (Language)

**Focus:** Sentence-level precision

#### The McPhee Method

1. **Box vague words** → Replace with precise terms
2. **Green unnecessary words** → Cut 10-20%
3. **Vary sentence rhythm** → Mix lengths
4. **Front-load importance** → Key info first
5. **Kill filler words:** very, really, basically, just, actually
