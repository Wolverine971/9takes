# Content Creation Workflow

_Last Modified: 2025-12-04_
_Purpose: Step-by-step process for creating high-quality blog content_

## Overview

This document provides the complete workflow for creating, editing, and optimizing blog content for 9takes. Follow this process for consistent, high-quality output.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Planning

### Before You Write

**Goal:** Align the idea, audience, and CTA before drafting.

#### Quick Planning Template

Fill this out for every piece:

- **Title:** [SEO-optimized, compelling]
- **Target Keyword:** [Primary search term]
- **Search Volume:** [Monthly searches]
- **Audience:** [Specific segment]
- **Job to be Done:** [What problem are they solving?]
- **Promise:** "After reading this, you'll be able to..."
- **Primary CTA:** [One clear action]
- **Content Angle:** [What's unique/contrarian?]
- **Proof Sources:** [Data, examples, case studies]
- **Success Metric:** [How we measure success]
- **Internal Links:** [3-5 related posts]

#### Audience & Voice Planning

> **Why this matters:** Content that doesn't match where your reader is in their journey will fall flat. A new reader won't respond to expert-voice advice they haven't earned trust to receive. These frameworks help you match content to audience.
>
> **Deep dive:** See [`/docs/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](../viral-coach-framework-reference.md) for full explanations of these frameworks.

**1. Funnel Stage** — Where is this content in the reader's journey?

| Stage                  | Purpose             | Reader State           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ☐ **Top of Funnel**    | Attract new readers | Doesn't know you yet   |
| ☐ **Middle of Funnel** | Build trust         | Interested, evaluating |
| ☐ **Bottom of Funnel** | Convert to action   | Ready to act           |

**2. Trust Onion Layer** — Where does your reader place blame right now?

| Layer        | They Blame                           | Your Approach                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ☐ **Outer**  | Circumstances (time, money, society) | Validate struggles first, offer quick wins |
| ☐ **Middle** | Specific people (boss, ex, parents)  | Pattern recognition, strategic advice      |
| ☐ **Inner**  | Themselves                           | Coaching content (only if trust is built)  |

**9takes insight:** Most new readers are at the Outer layer. Content that jumps straight to "here's what YOU'RE doing wrong" loses them. Meet them where they are.

**3. Voice (EEO Continuum)** — How authoritative should you sound?

| Voice             | Use When          | Example                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ☐ **Observation** | New/cold audience | "Studies show Type 5s tend to..."  |
| ☐ **Experience**  | Warming audience  | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| ☐ **Expert**      | Trusted audience  | "Type 5s do this because..."       |

**Mapping guideline:**

| If Funnel Stage is... | Default Trust Layer | Default Voice |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Top of Funnel         | Outer               | Observation   |
| Middle of Funnel      | Middle              | Experience    |
| Bottom of Funnel      | Inner               | Expert        |

**4. Social Repurposing Plan** (for Content Flywheel)

Every blog post should generate social content. Plan it now:

- Thread hook: ******\_\_\_\_******
- Standalone tweet angles: ******\_\_\_\_******
- Question/poll: ******\_\_\_\_******

### Content Type Decision Tree

```
Is it filling a critical gap? → Priority 1
├── Yes + High search volume → IMMEDIATE
├── Yes + Low search volume → This week
└── No → Check other factors
    ├── Monetization potential? → Priority 2
    ├── Authority building? → Priority 3
    └── Community value? → Priority 4
```

## Phase 2: Structure First (McPhee Method)

### The Invisible Architecture

**Goal:** Make the structure strong but invisible to readers.

#### Structural Options

Choose based on content type:

1. **Problem → Cause → Solution** (Most common)
   - Open with relatable problem
   - Explore root causes
   - Provide actionable solutions

2. **Chronological Journey**
   - Past state → Present challenge → Future solution
   - Good for transformation content

3. **Type-by-Type Analysis** (Enneagram standard)
   - Introduction to concept
   - Type 1 through Type 9
   - Synthesis and conclusion

4. **Question & Answer**
   - Series of related questions
   - Deep answers with examples
   - Natural FAQ format

### Beat Outline Template

```markdown
# Title (H1)

## Hook & Promise (150 words)

- Emotional/controversial opening
- Clear promise
- Roadmap preview

## [Core Concept] (H2)

### The Hidden Psychology (H3)

### [Specific aspect] (H3)

## Action Steps (H2)

## Phase 3: Drafting for Substance

### Writing Guidelines

#### Voice & Tone

- **Direct and concise** - No fluff
- **Psychologically insightful** - Show depth
- **Modern but professional** - Current references
- **Practical over theoretical** - Action-focused
- **Data-driven when possible** - Back up claims

#### Content Requirements

- **Length:** 2,500-3,500 words optimal
- **Time to Value:** Quick win in first 300 words
- **Specifics:** Numbers, examples, scripts
- **Tables/Lists:** Every 300-400 words
- **Internal Links:** 3-5 related posts
- **External Authority:** 1-2 credible sources

#### The 9takes Formula

1. **Emotional Hook** - Start with feeling
2. **Pattern Recognition** - "You've probably noticed..."
3. **Psychological Insight** - "Here's why..."
4. **Type-Specific Application** - "For Type X..."
5. **Practical Tools** - Scripts, frameworks, exercises
6. **Clear Next Step** - Specific action

## Phase 4: Two-Pass Editing System

### Pass 1: Macro Edit (Structure)

**Focus:** Big picture coherence

- [ ] Does the lead deliver the promise?
- [ ] Is there a clear through-line?
- [ ] Do sections flow logically?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth?
- [ ] Is the structure invisible?
- [ ] Does it resolve the tension?

**Actions:**

- Reorder sections if needed
- Merge redundant parts
- Split complex sections
- Add missing beats
- Strengthen transitions

### Pass 2: Micro Edit (Language)

**Focus:** Sentence-level precision

#### The McPhee Method

1. **Box vague words** → Replace with precise terms
2. **Green unnecessary words** → Cut 10-20%
3. **Vary sentence rhythm** → Mix lengths
4. **Front-load importance** → Key info first
5. **Kill filler words:** very, really, basically, just, actually

#### Reading Level Check

**Why this matters:** Simpler content reaches more people. A huge portion of the population has a reading level below 6th grade. Complexity isn't intelligence—clarity is.

1. Paste your content into [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
2. **Target:** Grade 6 or lower
3. Simplify complex sentences
4. Replace jargon with everyday words
5. Short sentences beat long ones

#### Quick Edit Checklist

- [ ] Cut opening throat-clearing
- [ ] Remove hedging language
- [ ] Replace passive voice
- [ ] Eliminate redundancy
- [ ] Check fact accuracy
- [ ] Verify internal links
- [ ] Reading level ≤ Grade 6
- [ ] Voice matches funnel stage (see [Audience & Voice Planning](#audience--voice-planning))

## Phase 5: SEO & Technical Optimization

### SEO Checklist

- [ ] Title tag: 50-60 characters
- [ ] Meta description: 150-160 characters
- [ ] URL slug: Short, keyword-rich
- [ ] H1: Contains primary keyword
- [ ] H2s: Question-based when possible
- [ ] First paragraph: Include keyword naturally
- [ ] Image alt text: Descriptive, keyword-aware

3. Update related posts with links
4. Schedule email newsletter
5. Plan Twitter thread
6. Track initial metrics

### Content Flywheel Checklist (Required)

**Why this matters:** High-effort content (blog posts) should generate low-effort content (tweets), which drives engagement, which generates ideas for new blog posts. This creates momentum—the more you create, the faster the wheel spins. Reposting successful content extends its value.

> **Deep dive:** See [`/docs/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](../viral-coach-framework-reference.md#4-content-flywheel) for the full Content Flywheel concept.

Every blog post should generate these within 48 hours:

- [ ] **1 X Thread** - Break post into 6-10 tweets with strong hook
- [ ] **3-5 Standalone Tweets** - Individual insights from the post
- [ ] **1 "9 Takes" Post** - If applicable (one situation, 9 reactions)
- [ ] **1 Question/Poll** - From FAQ or key insight
- [ ] **Schedule Repost** - Add best performer to calendar for 4-6 weeks out

**Flywheel Metrics to Track:**

- Which tweets performed best? (for repost scheduling)
- Which angles got most engagement? (for future content ideas)
- What questions came up in replies? (for future blog posts)
