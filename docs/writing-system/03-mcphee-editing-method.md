# The McPhee Editing Method

_Last Modified: 2025-08-15_
_Based on: John McPhee's "Draft No. 4" principles_
_Purpose: Create structurally perfect content with invisible architecture_

## Core Philosophy

### The McPhee Principle

"Structure is the most important element in writing. Get the structure right, and the prose will follow."

The goal: Create such natural structure that readers never notice it—they just feel compelled to keep reading.

## The Structure-First Approach

### Step 1: Find Your Through-Line

Every piece needs ONE central question it answers.

#### Examples:

- "Why do I keep sabotaging my relationships?"
- "How can I read anyone in 30 seconds?"
- "What makes each personality type ghost?"

This question drives everything. Every section must serve it.

### Step 2: Choose Your Architecture

#### The ABC Structure

Most common, most invisible:

- **A:** Beginning (setup)
- **B:** Middle (exploration)
- **C:** End (resolution)

But the magic is in the variations:

- ABCBA (mirror structure)
- ABCDCBA (pyramid)
- ABABAB (alternating)

#### For Enneagram Content:

The "Type Parade" structure:

```
Setup → Type 1 → Type 2 → ... → Type 9 → Synthesis
```

Each type section mirrors the others, creating rhythm.

### Step 3: Create Your Beat Sheet

Before writing, outline your beats (sections) with their PURPOSE:

```markdown
Beat 1: Hook - Create tension
Beat 2: Promise - Set expectation  
Beat 3: Pattern reveal - First insight
Beat 4: Deep dive - Core psychology
Beat 5: Examples - Make it real
Beat 6: Application - Make it actionable
Beat 7: Resolution - Satisfy the tension
```

## The Two-Draft System

### Draft 1: Get the Bones Right

Write for structure, not style.

#### Focus on:

- Does each beat serve its purpose?
- Do transitions feel inevitable?
- Is the through-line clear?
- Does tension build and resolve?

#### Ignore:

- Perfect sentences
- Grammar
- Word choice
- Polish

### Draft 2: Flesh and Polish

Now refine the language.

#### The McPhee Tools:

1. **Boxing:** Mark weak words for replacement
2. **Greening:** Cut 10-20% without leaving scars
3. **Rhythm:** Vary sentence lengths deliberately
4. **Precision:** Dictionary-diving for exact words

## The Boxing Technique

### How to Box:

Draw boxes around vague, weak, or cliché words.

#### Common Box Candidates:

- Very, really, quite, just, actually
- Thing, stuff, aspect, factor
- Good, bad, nice, interesting
- Get, make, do, have
- Important, significant, meaningful

#### The Replacement Process:

1. Box the weak word
2. List 5 specific alternatives
3. Check dictionary for precision
4. Choose the most exact word
5. Test in context

#### Example:

```
Before: "This is really important for understanding types."
Boxed: [really] [important]
Alternatives: crucial, essential, fundamental, vital, pivotal
After: "This is fundamental to understanding types."
```

## The Greening Technique

### The 10-20% Rule:

Every draft can lose 10-20% of its words without losing meaning.

#### How to Green:

Use green highlighter (or digital equivalent) to mark deletable text.

#### Prime Targets:

1. **Throat-clearing openings:** "In this article, we'll explore..."
2. **Redundancies:** "First began," "end result," "past history"
3. **Hedge words:** "Perhaps," "somewhat," "rather"
4. **Filler phrases:** "In order to," "the fact that," "there is/are"
5. **Unnecessary amplifiers:** "Very," "really," "quite," "totally"

#### Example:

```
Before (32 words):
"In order to really understand the fact that Type 2s have a tendency to give too much in their relationships, we need to first look at their childhood patterns."

After (19 words):
"To understand why Type 2s over-give in relationships, we examine their childhood patterns."

Reduction: 41%
```

## Transition Mastery

### The Invisible Bridge

Good transitions feel inevitable, not forced.

#### McPhee's Transition Types:

1. **The Echo:**
   End one section with an image/idea, begin next with related image.

```
End: "...leaving them exhausted from giving."
Start: "That exhaustion has a name: Helper's Burnout."
```

2. **The Question:**
   End with implied question, begin with answer.

```
End: "But why do they keep repeating this pattern?"
Start: "The answer lies in their childhood..."
```

3. **The Pivot Word:**
   One word bridges two ideas.

```
End: "...she finally understood the pattern."
Start: "Pattern recognition is the first step..."
```

4. **The Time Jump:**
   Temporal transitions feel natural.

```
End: "That was Tuesday."
Start: "By Friday, everything had changed."
```

## Rhythm and Music

### The Sentence Symphony

Vary sentence lengths for rhythm:

- Short. (Impact)
- Medium for information. (Flow)
- Long sentences work when you need to develop complex ideas, allowing the reader to settle into a rhythm before you shift again. (Depth)
- Short again. (Reset)

### The Paragraph Beat

- 1-2 sentences: Punch
- 3-4 sentences: Standard
- 5-6 sentences: Deep dive
- Never more than 6 for digital reading

### The Section Rhythm

Alternate between:

- Dense → Light
- Complex → Simple
- Abstract → Concrete
- General → Specific

## The Dictionary Dive

### McPhee's Dictionary Method:

Don't just use a thesaurus. Use a dictionary to understand precise meanings.

#### The Process:

1. Identify the concept you need
2. Look up 5-10 related words
3. Read their etymologies
4. Understand their exact differences
5. Choose based on precision, not sound

#### Example:

Need a word for "someone who gives too much":

- **Generous:** Liberal in giving (positive)
- **Profligate:** Recklessly extravagant (negative)
- **Lavish:** Expending profusely (neutral)
- **Munificent:** Extremely generous (formal)
- **Prodigal:** Wastefully extravagant (biblical)

Choice depends on exact shade of meaning needed.

## The Lead Paragraph

### McPhee's Lead Rules:

1. **No throat-clearing** - Start in the middle
2. **Create questions** - Don't answer everything
3. **Set rhythm** - Establish prose music
4. **Promise value** - Make reader invest

### Lead Formulas:

#### The Scene Lead:

Drop reader into specific moment.

```
"She checked her phone for the fifteenth time. Nothing. The Type 2's worst nightmare was happening: they didn't need her anymore."
```

#### The Statement Lead:

Bold claim that demands proof.

```
"Your Enneagram type determines how you'll destroy your next relationship."
```

#### The Question Lead:

Direct engagement with reader's mind.

```
"Why do you always attract the same toxic person in different bodies?"
```

## The Ending

### McPhee's Ending Principles:

- Satisfy the promise
- Echo the beginning
- Leave them changed
- Resist the summary

### Ending Types:

#### The Callback:

Return to opening image/story with new meaning.

#### The Projection:

Point toward reader's future.

#### The Expansion:

Zoom out to bigger picture.

#### The Question:

Leave them with something to ponder.

- [ ] Does structure support meaning?
- [ ] Is there a satisfying arc?

### Language Revision:

- [ ] Box all weak words
- [ ] Green 10-20% of text
- [ ] Vary sentence rhythms
- [ ] Check word precision
- [ ] Polish transitions

### Reader Experience:

- [ ] Does it flow naturally?

## Common McPhee Applications

### For How-To Content:

Structure around the reader's journey, not your expertise.

### For Analysis Content:

Structure around patterns, not categories.

### For Story Content:

Structure around tension, not chronology.

### For List Content:

Structure around logic, not randomness.

## The Ultimate Test

### The Structural Integrity Test:

1. Strip away all the prose
2. Look only at section headers
3. Do they tell a complete story?
4. Could someone understand the arc from headers alone?

If yes, your structure is solid.
If no, revise the bones before polishing prose.

## McPhee's Final Wisdom

"Writing is selection. First you choose what to write about. Then you choose the words to write with. Most of all, you choose the order in which to arrange those words. Structure is choice multiplied by choice multiplied by choice."

Every choice should serve your through-line.
Every word should earn its place.
Every section should feel inevitable.

That's when structure becomes invisible—and irresistible.
