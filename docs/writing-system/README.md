## Strategic Frameworks for Audience-Aware Writing

**What this section is:** These frameworks help you write content that matches where your reader is in their journey. Content that doesn't match the reader's trust level or mindset will fall flat—even if the advice is good.

**Where these come from:** These are adapted from the Viral Coach Masterclass, a professional content coaching course. The full course notes with deeper explanations are available at:

> **Reference:** [`/docs/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](../viral-coach-framework-reference.md)

### 1. Content Flywheel

**The concept:** High-effort content (blog posts) should generate low-effort content (tweets), which drives engagement, which generates ideas for new blog posts. This creates compounding momentum.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONTENT FLYWHEEL                     │
│                                                         │
│    Blog Post (High Effort, High Trust)                  │
│         │                                               │
│         ├──► X Thread (Medium Effort)                   │
│         ├──► Single Tweets (Low Effort)                 │
│         └──► Future blog ideas from engagement          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule:** Every blog post should generate 5-10 social posts. Schedule reposts of winners.

### 2. Content Funnel (ToF/MoF/BoF)

**The concept:** All content serves one of three stages in the audience journey. The funnel stage determines voice, CTA intensity, and content approach.

| Stage                | Purpose             | Voice                              | CTA Intensity         |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Top of Funnel**    | Attract new readers | Observation ("I noticed...")       | None or soft          |
| **Middle of Funnel** | Build trust         | Experience ("In my experience...") | Soft (read more)      |
| **Bottom of Funnel** | Convert             | Expert ("Here's the truth...")     | Direct (sign up, buy) |

**9takes gap:** Most content is Middle/Bottom. Target 50% Top of Funnel to grow faster.

### 3. Trust Onion Framework 🧅

**The concept:** Your audience places blame at different layers. Content must meet readers where they are before asking them to take responsibility.

| Layer      | They Blame                           | Content Approach                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Outer**  | Circumstances (time, money, society) | Validate external struggles, offer quick wins |
| **Middle** | Specific people (boss, ex, parents)  | Pattern recognition, strategic advice         |
| **Inner**  | Themselves                           | Motivational, coaching content                |

**9takes insight:** New readers are at the OUTER layer. Content that jumps straight to "here's what you're doing wrong" loses them. Meet them where they are first.

### 4. EEO Continuum (Voice Calibration)

**The concept:** Calibrate how authoritative you sound based on audience trust level.

| Voice           | Use When          | Example                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Observation** | New/cold audience | "Studies show Type 5s tend to..."  |
| **Experience**  | Warming audience  | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| **Expert**      | Trusted audience  | "Type 5s do this because..."       |

**Default for 9takes blog posts:** Start with Observation/Experience, earn the Expert voice by the end.

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Strategy & Planning
    └── Fill out planning template
    └── Identify funnel stage + Trust Onion layer

Phase 2: Structure First (McPhee Method)
    └── Choose structural pattern

Phase 3: Drafting for Substance
    └── Write following 9takes formula
    └── Match voice to EEO Continuum

Phase 4: Two-Pass Editing
    ├── Pass 1: Macro (structure)
    └── Pass 2: Micro (language)
    └── Reading level check (Grade 6 target)

Phase 5: SEO & Technical
    └── Optimize for search

Phase 6: Final Review & Publish
    └── Quality checks and launch
    └── Execute Content Flywheel checklist
```

## The 9takes Formula (Quick Reference)

1. **Emotional Hook** - Start with feeling
2. **Pattern Recognition** - "You've probably noticed..."
3. **Psychological Insight** - "Here's why..."
4. **Type-Specific Application** - "For Type X..."
5. **Practical Tools** - Scripts, frameworks, exercises
6. **Clear Next Step** - Specific action

## Quality Standards

### Must-Haves

- Clear value proposition
- Actionable takeaways
- Type-specific insights
- Problem-focused title
- Quick Answer box
- 3-5 internal links
- Grade 6 reading level (use [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/))
- Funnel stage identified (ToF/MoF/BoF)
- Social repurposing plan (Content Flywheel)

### Never Include

- Hedging language ("tend to", "might")
- Academic/theoretical tone
- Walls of text
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Generic descriptions
- Expert voice in Top of Funnel content (use Observation voice instead)

---

## Post-Publish Checklist (Content Flywheel)

After every blog post, create:

- [ ] 1 X thread (6-10 tweets breaking down the post)
- [ ] 3-5 standalone tweets (individual insights)
- [ ] 1 "9 takes" format post (if applicable)
- [ ] 1 question/poll from the FAQ section
- [ ] Schedule repost of best performer (4-6 weeks out)
