## Strategic Frameworks for Audience-Aware Writing

**What this section is:** These frameworks help you write content that matches where your reader is in their journey. Content that doesn't match the reader's trust level or mindset will fall flat, even if the advice is good.

**Where these come from:** These are adapted from the Viral Coach Masterclass, a professional content coaching course. The full course notes with deeper explanations are available at:

> **Reference:** [`/docs/marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md`](../marketing/viral-coach-framework-reference.md)

### 1. Content Flywheel

**The concept:** High-effort content (blog posts) should generate low-effort content (tweets), which drives engagement, which generates ideas for new blog posts. This creates compounding momentum.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONTENT FLYWHEEL                     │
│                                                         │
│    Blog Post (High Effort, High Trust)                  │
│         │                                               │
│         ├──► X Thread (Medium Effort)                   │
│         ├──► Single Tweets (Low Effort)                 │
│         └──► Future blog ideas from engagement          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule:** Every blog post should generate 5-10 social posts. Schedule reposts of winners.

### 2. Content Funnel (ToF/MoF/BoF)

**The concept:** All content serves one of three stages in the audience journey. The funnel stage determines voice, CTA intensity, and content approach.

| Stage                | Purpose             | Voice                              | CTA Intensity         |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Top of Funnel**    | Attract new readers | Observation ("I noticed...")       | None or soft          |
| **Middle of Funnel** | Build trust         | Experience ("In my experience...") | Soft (read more)      |
| **Bottom of Funnel** | Convert             | Expert ("Here's the truth...")     | Direct (sign up, buy) |

**9takes gap:** Most content is Middle/Bottom. Target 50% Top of Funnel to grow faster.

### 3. Trust Onion Framework 🧅

**The concept:** Your audience places blame at different layers. Content must meet readers where they are before asking them to take responsibility.

| Layer      | They Blame                           | Content Approach                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Outer**  | Circumstances (time, money, society) | Validate external struggles, offer quick wins |
| **Middle** | Specific people (boss, ex, parents)  | Pattern recognition, strategic advice         |
| **Inner**  | Themselves                           | Motivational, coaching content                |

**9takes insight:** New readers are at the OUTER layer. Content that jumps straight to "here's what you're doing wrong" loses them. Meet them where they are first.

### 4. EEO Continuum (Voice Calibration)

**The concept:** Calibrate how authoritative you sound based on audience trust level.

| Voice           | Use When          | Example                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Observation** | New/cold audience | "Studies show Type 5s tend to..."  |
| **Experience**  | Warming audience  | "In my experience with Type 5s..." |
| **Expert**      | Trusted audience  | "Type 5s do this because..."       |

**Default for 9takes blog posts:** Start with Observation/Experience, earn the Expert voice by the end.

```

---

## The 9takes Formula (Quick Reference)

1. **Emotional Hook** - Start with feeling
2. **Pattern Recognition** - "You've probably noticed..."
3. **Psychological Insight** - "Here's why..."
4. **Type-Specific Application** - "For Type X..."
5. **Practical Tools** - Scripts, frameworks, exercises
6. **Clear Next Step** - Specific action

---

## Quality Standards

### Must-Haves

- **Write like you talk** - Every sentence should pass the "Would I say this to a friend?" test
- **Read aloud before publishing** - If it doesn't sound natural, rewrite it
- Clear value proposition
- Actionable takeaways
- Type-specific insights
- Problem-focused title
- Quick Answer box
- 3-5 internal links
- Target Grade 6-8 reading level (use [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/)), but keep SEO-valuable psychology terms (self-sabotage, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, etc.) and explain them naturally. Accessibility matters more than hitting a specific grade level.
- Funnel stage identified (ToF/MoF/BoF)
- Social repurposing plan (Content Flywheel)

### Never Include

- Hedging language ("tend to", "might")
- Academic/theoretical tone
- Formal/stiff language you wouldn't use in conversation
- Em-dashes (—): use periods, commas, colons, or parentheses instead
- AI-sounding words (nuanced, delve, embark, tapestry, intricate, multifaceted, ever-evolving, testament, realm, pivotal)
- Walls of text
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Generic descriptions
- Expert voice in Top of Funnel content (use Observation voice instead)

---

## Post-Publish Checklist (Content Flywheel)

After every blog post, create:

- [ ] 1 X thread (6-10 tweets breaking down the post)
- [ ] 3-5 standalone tweets (individual insights)
- [ ] 1 "9 takes" format post (if applicable)
- [ ] 1 question/poll from the FAQ section
- [ ] Schedule repost of best performer (4-6 weeks out)

## Case Study: Communication Tips Rewrite

_Completed: 2025-12-04_

This case study documents a full blog optimization from D-grade to A-grade using the writing system.

### The Problem

`enneagram-communication-tips.md` was identified in the [Blog Improvement Priority List](../content-analysis/blog-improvement-priority-list.md) as Priority 3.1:

| Issue             | Before                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Grade             | D                                          |
| Hook              | Weak generic ("Want to talk with anyone?") |
| Depth             | ~5 bullet points per type                  |
| Childhood mapping | None                                       |
| Scripts           | None                                       |
| Tables            | None                                       |
| Quick Answer      | Missing                                    |
| Internal links    | 0 outgoing                                 |
| Differentiation   | Overlapping with `communication-styles.md` |

### Phase 1: Strategy & Planning

**Differentiation decision:** The related post `communication-styles.md` (A-grade, 9 incoming links) covers the "why" (understanding patterns). The rewrite should focus on the "what": tactical scripts for specific scenarios.

| Element        | Decision                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target keyword | "how to communicate with each enneagram type"                 |
| Content angle  | Word-for-word scripts you can use today                       |
| Funnel stage   | Middle of Funnel (some Enneagram knowledge)                   |
| Trust Onion    | Outer → Middle (validate struggles, offer tactical solutions) |
| Voice          | Experience voice (practical, tested)                          |

### Phase 2: Structure (McPhee Method)

Chose **Problem-Solution + Type-by-Type Analysis** hybrid structure:

```
Hook (communication disaster) →
Quick Answer box →
Why your words miss (filter table) →
Type 1-9 sections (childhood origin + scripts + what NOT to say) →
Quick reference table →
Crosslinks →
CTA
```

Each type section follows identical rhythm:

1. What's Happening Inside Their Head (childhood origin)
2. The Golden Rule (one-line principle)
3. Scripts for Common Scenarios (3 scenarios, ✅ and ❌ examples)
4. The Magic Phrase (one transformational line)
5. Link to type page

### Phase 3: Drafting

Applied the 9takes formula:

- **Emotional hook:** "I said exactly what I meant. Why did they get so upset?"
- **Pattern recognition:** Same words = different meaning to each type
- **Psychological insight:** Childhood filters explain miscommunication
- **Type-specific application:** Scripts for each type's scenarios
- **Practical tools:** Exact phrases to use and avoid
- **Clear next step:** Pick one person, try one script

### Phase 4: Editing

- Varied sentence length for rhythm
- Removed hedging language ("tend to", "might", "perhaps")
- Front-loaded key info in each section
- Kept paragraphs to 2-3 sentences for mobile

### Phase 5: SEO & Crosslinks

**Title:** "What to Say to Each Enneagram Type (Scripts That Actually Work)"

**Added 5+ internal links:**

- `/enneagram-corner/enneagram-communication-styles` (main crosslink)
- `/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-in-stress`
- `/enneagram-corner/relationship-communication-guide`
- `/enneagram-corner/how-each-enneagram-type-self-sabotages-success`
- `/enneagram-corner/toxic-traits-of-each-enneagram-type`
- All 9 type pages

**Added:**

- QuickAnswer component for featured snippets
- Comparison tables (filter table, quick reference table)
- Updated JSON-LD with FAQPage schema

### Results

| Metric            | Before                  | After                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Title             | Generic ("Tips for...") | Problem-focused ("What to Say...")    |
| Hook              | Weak                    | Emotional ("Why did they get upset?") |
| Word count        | ~1,200                  | ~3,400                                |
| Tables            | 0                       | 3                                     |
| Scripts           | 0                       | 27 (3 per type)                       |
| Internal links    | 0                       | 15+                                   |
| Quick Answer      | Missing                 | Added                                 |
| Childhood mapping | None                    | All 9 types                           |
| Grade             | D                       | A                                     |

### Key Learnings

1. **Differentiation is strategy:** Before rewriting, identify what the NEW angle is. This post became "tactical scripts" vs. the existing "understanding patterns" post.

2. **Childhood-to-adult mapping adds depth:** A single paragraph explaining WHY each type communicates this way transforms generic tips into psychological insight.

3. **Scripts are high value:** "What to say when..." is immediately actionable. ✅/❌ examples are scannable.

4. **Tables break up type-by-type monotony:** The filter table in the intro and quick reference table at the end create visual variety in a 9-section structure.

5. **Crosslinks serve readers AND SEO:** Linking to related content (stress, relationships, toxic traits) keeps readers on site and builds topical authority.
