Create a blog post about how creating a community based on personality is better than creating a community based on random interests. 

If you are going to Reddit to find community and find like-minded friends, stop it. Stop it now.

People think that if they find people with the same interests, they will like the people and make friends. But those interests are surface level. What is more interesting is to think about what it is about those interests that you are attracted to. What is about you and your identity that makes you gravitate towards those topics, then look for those same things in other people and connect with them on who they are as a persona and why they resonate with certain things. The topics and interests are surface-level. The reasons why people are drawn to things are deep, and they make up our personality.
