<p class="firstLetter">What is the a definition of human nature?</p>

Philosophers and psychologists have talked about human nature a lot but did they come to a consensus? Is there a peer-reviewed study that shows what human nature is? No, not really. But there have been two main perspectives that keep coming up in different circles that we are going to examine in this blog.

One theory of human nature is about how humans fluctuate between being logical and illogical, and our goal is to be rational. The other theory is more complicated and less explored. The philosophers Plato and Aristotle had opposing views on this, and this mirrors the opposing views of the psychologists Sigmund Freud and Steven Pinker.

## Plato is to Aristotle as Freud is to Pinker

**Plato** had a complicated view of human nature. He thought of human nature as having three distinct parts, calling it the "Tripartite Soul." These parts were the rational soul that governed the logical intellect. Then, the spirited soul was the source of emotions and courage. And lastly, there was the appetitive soul, which was associated with desires and bodily needs.

**Aristotle**, however, thought that the defining feature of humans was our capacity to be rational. He talked about how humans were social and that morals were important, but our rationality set us apart.

Similarly **Freud** had a complicated view of human nature that mirrored Plato's view, where there was an interplay between three elements: the id, ego, and superego that pull at the human psyche.

However, again, like Aristotle, the modern psychologist **Steven Pinker** focuses on rationality. He calls on humans to be rational to mitigate potential chaos.

<!-- ## What was Plato's view?

Plato talked about the human soul and about how it was divided into three parts: **reason**, **spirit**, and **appetite** which formed something called the "tripartite soul." Reason, associated with the rational part of the soul, represents wisdom, intellect, and the capacity for logical thinking üß†. Spirit, associated with the spirited or emotional part of the soul, represents courage, honor, and the pursuit of noble ideals ‚ù§Ô∏è. Appetite, associated with the bodily or sensual part of the soul, represents the desires, passions, and basic physical needs üí™. -->

## Plato and Freud's concepts unified

Freud's theory of the mind like Plato describes three components: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id can be seen as analogous to Plato's appetite, representing the instinctual and primitive drives üí™. The ego, like Plato's reason, represents the rational and conscious aspect of the mind, mediating between the id's demands and the external reality üß†. The superego, similar to Plato's spirit, represents internalized societal values and moral standards ‚ù§Ô∏è.

| **Appetite-** all the primal, fundamental drives such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, and other bodily urges | üí™    | **Id-** instinctual part of the mind, operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate satisfaction of basic drives |

So who has built upon these theories? Where are we today?

## Pinker calling for Rationality

</div>

If only we could purge all the misinformation and fake news. If only we could establish a ministry of truth. If only people were smarter and more rational.

It's easy to boil things down to being rational and irrational, it makes everything black and white. Who doesn‚Äôt want to live in a simple world?

- ‚ÄúI am right and you are wrong‚Äù,
- ‚ÄúI am rational, you are irrational‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI was once wrong but now I have learned and am right again, I was irrational but now I am back to being rational‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe are not making progress because we are irrational and we need to be more rational‚Äù

What if everything wasn't that simple? What if we are oversimplifying the problem by boiling human nature down to the pursuit of being rational?

## Explaining the repeated calls for rationality

Freud talked in great depth about his theory of the conscious and unconscious mind. He suggested that a significant portion of our mental processes occurs outside of our conscious awareness. Freud thought that the unconscious mind contains repressed thoughts, memories, desires, and unresolved conflicts that influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

A potential reason why discussions often focus on the rational aspect of the psyche, while neglecting the other parts is because the rational or conscious mind is more readily accessible and controllable. We have a direct awareness of our conscious thoughts and can easily articulate our logical ideas.

In contrast, the unconscious aspects of the psyche are not immediately accessible. It is easier to critique someone's logic than it is their perceived morals or instincts.

### Andrew Huberman on the model of the mind

Here is [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab) and Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine talking about this iceberg model of the mind.

## Wrapping it up

So did Aristotle and Pinker successfully simplify human nature? Or were Plato and Freud on to something? If you thought they were onto something check out the <a href="/blog/enneagram/beginners-guide-to-determining-your-enneagram-type" >Enneagram</a>. It shares many similar concepts but it has no direct lineage to Plato or Freud. Perhaps the reoccurring 3 divisions that we keep stumbling upon form a better model for understanding "human nature." 9takes is on a quest to poke and prod at these divisions because we think there is still a lot to learn. And maybe, just maybe we can start to heal the human psyche and soul.
