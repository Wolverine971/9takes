Ever tried to crowdsource your conflict online? Hereâ€™s how to effectively leverage the wisdom of the crowd to resolve your dilemmas.

Step 1: Initiate the Conflict
Start by creating a situation ripe for discussion.

Engage in a light-hearted but provocative conversation with someone close, like texting something cheeky to an ex or a family member. Alternatively, post a politically charged statement on Facebook or stir up some office gossip. These actions will generate a variety of responses and set the stage for your crowdsourcing endeavor.

Ensure the conflict is engaging enough to garner interest but manageable to keep the discussion constructive.

Step 2: Select the Right Platform
Choosing where to post is crucial for constructive feedback.

While Reddit's r/relationships subreddit is an excellent place for personal dilemmas, remember it can be biased. Twitter's effectiveness is tied to how many followers you have, and Facebook might not always be the best for serious discussions. Quora provides well-reasoned answers, but they may lack the personal touch you're looking for.

Pick a platform that aligns with the nature of your conflict and the type of advice you desire.

Step 3: Try 9takes
9takes offers a unique approach to resolving conflicts.

On 9takes, you can post your conflict anonymously and receive feedback from users who can't see other comments until they've added their own. This setup encourages unbiased and diverse responses, sorted by the commenter's personality type, providing you with a spectrum of perspectives.

This method not only helps you but also creates a repository of conflicts and solutions for others to learn from.

By crowdsourcing your conflict, you're not just solving your own problems but also contributing to a broader understanding of conflict resolution online. Next time you find yourself in a tricky situation, consider turning to the collective intelligence of platforms like 9takes.
