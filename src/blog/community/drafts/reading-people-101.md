Using the enneagram to read people is simple. Just follow these 3 steps:

<!-- All you do is guage what emotion is radiating off of them -->

1. Guage what emotion is radiating off of them.
2. Prope for that emotion like like a doctor of science.
3. Observe the activation, repression, or numbness in response to sed probing.

Let me give you an example.

You walk into a bar.

Hot girl at the bar. Or hot guy.

You want hot girl/ guy at the bar to fall in love with you like a fairy tale.

Whats your move?

Bingo you just remembered the 3 step plan from 9takes on how to read people.

First guage what emotion is radiating off of them.

There are 3 emotions to work off of and they are negative. The negative emotions have complementary positive emotions.

Fear- could come off as anxious, or timid. Could also come off as ADHD, they are very cerebral, mentally fast and smart. The positive form would be confident. They are attuned to the intellect.

Shame- could come off as insecurity. The positive version would be pride or indifference. As in they are full of themselves. They would be prideful in response to feeling ashamed or insecure. They are very attuned to emotions.

Anger- now they wont outwardly be angry but they will be sharp and domineering. As in don't test me I bite. The positive version would be peaceful as in taking everything in and moving with ease. They are very attuned to their body and have a visible physicality.

Next step is to probe like a doctor of science. Try to guess what emotion is radiating off of them before approaching.

Here are some ways to probe.

- give a compliment
- ask them for help with something
-

If you cannot tell by just looking the next step is to probe like a man or woman doctor of science
