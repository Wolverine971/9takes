<!-- This is how you do it.

You ask yourself what does this person want me to think and feel about them.

Ask yourself what do they want out of life.

This first occurred to me when I looked at my brother. He didn't want what I wanted out of life. He had very different motivations than what I had. And this baffled me. It felt to me like we were playing life by different rules.

It felt like I was following the rules of life and he was ignoring them and getting away with it. I was the white knight. My brother was the dark knight.

I was Thor
He was Loki

I was Esau
He was Jacob

I was Cain
And he was Able.

I was both the rule follower and the bad guy.

I was older and yet my younger brother constantly seemed to best me. He was faster than me, funnier than me, and the girls found him to be cuter than me. I felt like I could not win. The only area where I was better than him was when it came to strength.

I could beat my younger brother up.

And yet every time I beat him up, he seemed to win more.

I would tilt. I would rage. I would lash out and cry out at the unfairness. And my brother would laugh. -->

There was a second frustration.

That was that others seemed to not understand me. And I could not figure out why. To me I was a rational actor. Everyone else was crazy.

Here is the 4 step process for pyschoanalyzing yourself.

Reddit says [its impossible to psychoanalyze yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychoanalysis/comments/b7k2e9/is_is_possible_to_psychoanalyze_yourself/) but I don't think so.

I am not a psychologist and I didnt psychoanalyze myself by myself and yet I still think its possible. Try this out and decide for yourself.

First thing to do is to ask yourself what do you want out of life?

That is the main question.

It can be worded differently though.

What is your main motivation in life?

Or what do you want other people to feel about you?

- What you want out of life --> end goal
- What is your motivation --> the reason you want the end goal
- What you want other people to feel about you --> the feeling you want to get at the end

This reason you ask yourself these questions is because other people have different answers.

Yes not everyone wants the same thing.

Yes in general people want to be happy, have world peace and accomplish something but those are surface level wants.

What needs to happen for you to die fufilled and happy.

That right there is enough to chew on and think about for quite a while but lets keep going.

This next question is gets at the opposite driving force behind your motivation.

It is the question "what is your biggest fear"

Or what is your disaster scenario?

It might be tied to your motivation.
