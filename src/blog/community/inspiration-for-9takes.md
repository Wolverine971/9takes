<p class="firstLetter">Marriage is a forcing function for developing emotional intelligence.</p>

At least it was for me.

When I got married, my wife and I were in marital bliss! But that quickly wore off as reality set in that we were each married to flawed people who saw the world very differently. We seemed to be fighting more than what we thought was normal. And our attempts to resolve the conflict kept failing.

Eventually, we turned to counseling and personality tests to help us understand each other.

## What we learned through counseling and personality tests

After my wife and I failed multiple times to resolve our conflict, we went to counseling.

At the time, many topics of conversation would quickly lead to yelling and/or tears. The counselor we went to helped us get the conversation going to a place where we could both listen to each other (deep dive into listening later). We realized we were jumping to conclusions and operating on autopilot in many conversations. We were being "triggered" (this was a new concept for me). We also realized that the things we say to each other can mean completely different things.

We were being triggered and rushing to conclusions.

Over time, we zeroed in on our differences by taking personality tests. Intellectually, we knew we were different, but we would get surprised every time the other person didn't see things our way. The personality tests started to give us language around our thoughts and feelings. We started with the MBTI and then moved on to the Enneagram because it went deeper, uncovering our emotional baggage ([MBTI and Enneagram comparison](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-vs-meyers-briggs)).

As we started diving deep into all these personality layers, listening became the most important skill that we were developing.

## What it means to "listen"

The trick we learned through counseling was how to listen to each other.

It's not about quietly letting the other person talk. It is about making the other person feel like you understand them. Sometimes, people say you must show empathy or "mirror" the other person. But you are trying to make the other person feel like you get them.

This is echoed by an FBI hostage negotiator, Chris Voss. He talks about how negotiations aren't about logic but making the other side feel completely understood.

We learned that most of your relationship problems can be sorted out if you slow down and listen to each other. I noticed that this seemed to be the main thing therapists do. Therapists don‚Äôt talk at you; they sit and listen to you and help you feel understood before they give any input.

## What happens when you don't feel understood

It is not a small thing seeking to be understood. People do unexpected things when they don‚Äôt feel understood.

- They may stop talking to you.
- They may feel depressed.
- They may think you are dumb.
- They may start a personal vendetta against you to make you understand.

<!-- Its as if you are saying that they don't belong. -->

When someone comes to you trying to express something and they feel as though you don't understand them, its as if you are saying that their reality doesn't make sense. They need to change and think, feel and do things that do make sense.

<!-- Obviously this can happen to varying degrees but it is no small thing when someone doesn't feel understood. -->

There are a range of emotions that can pop up when someone feels like they aren't being understood.

- They might feel anger towards the person who is not understanding.
- They might feel anxious that they aren't making sense.
- They may feel like like an outcast and that they don't belong.

Be on the look out for a topic changing too fast. Be on the lookout for someone suddenly becoming quiet. Be on the lookout for someone saying "you are not listening to me." You may be listening but the other person does not feel understood.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è My wife and I reacted in all the ways listed above. We felt all of the above emotions. It wasn't good.

<!-- So they will go away and talk to someone where their reality does make sense. They may only give you one chance

what you are saying to the other person when you dont show that you understand them is that they are
They may have given you a chance and opened up to you but

Get revenge- like a confirmation bias

Try to force you to understand -->

<!-- The topic gets changed too fast
They say "You are not listening to me"

They say, ‚ÄúYou are not listening to me.‚Äù The other side may be listening, but they must seek to understand. They may be butting in and interrupting. They may be thinking about counter-examples and comebacks. There are many reasons why someone might feel like they need to be listened to, which creates a gap between the two sides.

When an individual feels that they are not being heard, it can lead to a range of emotions. They might feel anger towards the person who is not listening. Their fear may grow if they feel like the other side isn‚Äôt listening when discussing topics that evoke fear. Additionally, if a person feels like they are being ignored, this can foster insecurity where they feel like they are less worthy of being heard. -->

### You, me, and others need to be listened to üëÇ

After having a series of conversations where my wife and I felt like we were understanding each other, she told me to take a personality test.

At first, I didn‚Äôt want to because I thought personality tests were pseudo-science. I didn't think I would get anything out of it. However, since I couldn‚Äôt solve our relationship problems, I figured that I should be open to other solutions and perspectives. I figured I had nothing to lose. So I gave it a shot.

And yeah, I got something out of it.

I was mind-blown ü§Ø. It was telling me things about myself that I felt but had never verbalized. It made me see myself from a bird‚Äôs eye view. It gave me a framework for understanding why I was the way I was. And I agreed with the framework. I wanted to know more about myself, my wife, and all the other people in my life. I went down a rabbit hole, reading everything I could about personality. A new language opened up to me. It felt like I had a secret.

<!-- Everyone was learning something
about themselves and was vulnerable and could listen and tried to talk about it with anyone who would listen.
The pushback -->

I would start conversations with other people about personality, but only some were open to it.

Some people didn't want to talk about personality, thinking it was pseudo-science like I had thought, and some people were straight-up hostile to it. I soon realized the back and forth was not helpful. I had been on a journey, but the other side needed to go on their own. üë£

It was better to ask specific questions.

### Questions are the key; they highlight our similarities and differences

Don't tell someone to go on a journey. Ask them questions that lead them on a journey.

I only started making progress when I started asking them questions.

<!-- //here -->

How are they similar or different from the other people in their lives? <a href="/personality-analysis" >What celebrity are they similar to?</a> If you start thinking about that, you can quickly get into discussions about personality. The responses usually fell into two broad categories:

- "I am too unique, and no one is like me"
- "I am like everyone else, everyone is the same"

Both responses were partially true. People are both similar and different. But it is a spectrum. There is a spectrum of similarities and differences between people. Realizing that spectrum is the unlock and it is where growth happens. At the extreme end, people feel like they have nothing to learn from exploring their personality.

- "People are too similar ‚û°Ô∏è there is nothing to learn from personality"
- "People are too different ‚û°Ô∏èthere is nothing to learn from personality"

These perspectives stifle curiosity. Have the person ever met someone similar to them? Have they ever met someone different from them? These similarities and differences are personality traits. That is all it is. Personality attempts to map out the dimensions by which people are similar and different.

### Finding a place to explore people‚Äôs similarities and differences

My next step was to find the place where people‚Äôs similarities and differences were being explored.

I checked out Reddit and Discord and scoured every internet community I could find. But the conversations were shallow and fragmented.

I felt like I had to build the thing I wanted.

I wanted to explore personality, specifically the <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-tldr">Enneagram</a>. I wanted to create a space where people could share their fears and motivations. I wanted to help people understand each other. I wanted to help other people who were fighting, like my wife and I. I wanted to create a place where people could openly share their opinions or **takes**.

The Enneagram has nine core personality types, which inspired me to use the name 9 takes, **9takes**. For every question that is asked, you can get at least 9 takes.

So that was the inspiration for 9takes.
