<p class="firstLetter">Marriage is a forcing function for developing emotional intelligence.</p>

At least, that is how it has been for me. When I married my wife, we were in marital bliss, yet we seemed to be fighting more than we thought typical. Our ways of resolving our conflict kept failing, and we eventually turned to personality tests to help us understand each other.

## What We Learned Through Therapy and Personality Tests

After my wife and I failed multiple times to resolve our conflict, we went to counseling.

At the time we could not start the conversation without it quickly leading to yelling or tears. The counselor helped us get the conversation going where we could both listen to each other. We will dive deeper into what it means to listen later but once we started listening, we realized we were stuck in some negative patterns. We were jumping to conclusions and operating on autopilot. After multiple sessions, we learned that different things we say to each other mean completely different things. I didn't like the word ‚Äútrigger,‚Äù but that is exactly what was happening when certain words were mentioned. We were being triggered and rushing to conclusions via our thoughts and emotions.

Over time we were narrowed in on our differences. This is where the personality tests came in, more on that later. Intellectually, we knew we were different, but we were getting surprised every time the other person wasn‚Äôt seeing things our way. We were slowly learning about the slew of baggage that we each carried.

## How To Listen

The trick we learned though counseling was how to listen to each other.

It‚Äôs not about quietly letting the other person talk. It is about making the other person feel like you understand them.

This is echoed by FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss. He talks about how negotiations aren‚Äôt about logic but about making the other side feel completely understood.

We learned that most of your relationship problems can be sorted out if you slow down and listen to each other. This, ironically, is the main thing therapists do. Therapists don‚Äôt talk at you; they sit there and listen to you and help you feel understood before they give any input at all.

## When you don't feel understood

People do crazy things when they don‚Äôt feel understood.

They say, ‚ÄúYou are not listening to me.‚Äù The other side may be listening, but they must seek to understand. They may be butting in and interrupting. They may be thinking about counter-examples and comebacks. There are many reasons why someone might feel like they need to be listened to, which creates a gap between the two sides.

When an individual feels that they are not being heard, it can lead to a range of emotions. They might feel anger towards the person who is not listening. Their fear may grow if they feel like the other side isn‚Äôt listening when discussing topics that evoke fear. Additionally, if a person feels like they are being ignored, this can foster insecurity where they feel like they are less worthy of being heard.

### People needed to be listened to. üëÇ

After having a series of conversations where my wife and I felt like we were getting it, she told me to take a personality test. 

At first, I didn‚Äôt want to because I thought it was pseudo-science and didn‚Äôt know I would get anything out of it. However, since I couldn‚Äôt solve our relationship problems alone, I should be open to other solutions and perspectives. I figured I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a shot.

And yeah, I got something out of it. I was mind-blown ü§Ø. It was telling me things about myself that I felt but had never verbalized. It made me think about myself in the third person from a bird‚Äôs eye view. I wanted to know more about myself, my wife, and the other personalities of people in my life. I went down a rabbit hole, reading everything I could about personality. A new language opened up to me, and it felt like I was unlocking ancient hidden secrets.

<!-- Everyone was learning something
about themselves and was vulnerable and could listen and tried to talk about it with anyone who would listen.
The pushback -->

I would start conversations with other people about personality, but only some were open to it. There were **those who were opposed** to talking about personality, and there were those who were straight-up hostile to it. There would be a back and forth, but I soon realized that nothing productive came trying to explain the journey I had been on. They needed to experience it for themselves when they were ready.

### Focus on questions that highlight our similarities and differences üë£

So, to help people on "the journey," I wanted to ask them a specific question. 

How are they similar or different from people? If you start thinking about that, you can quickly get into discussions about personality. The responses usually fell into two categories:

- One was that they thought they were too unique and no one was like them.
- Two was that they thought everyone was more or less like them and that any perceived distances were superficial.

Both responses were partially true. People are both similar and different. The middle perspective is where growth is, but at extreme ends, people feel like they have nothing to learn from personality and personality tests.

- People are too similar; therefore, there is nothing to learn from a personality test
- People are too different; there is nothing to learn from a personality test

These perspectives stifle curiosity. Have they never met someone similar to them? Have they ever met someone very different from them? These similarities and differences can be framed as personality traits. Personality attempts to map out the dimensions by which people are similar and different.

### Where are people's similarities and differences being explored? ü§î

My next step was to find where people were already conversing about their similarities and differences.

I checked out Reddit and a few Discord servers, but the conversations were shallow. Because I wanted more than the depth of discussion, I decided to build a place to explore people's similarities and differences. I knew I wanted to integrate personality and felt the <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-tldr">Enneagram</a> would be the best choice for fostering a good conversation. The Enneagram gets at people's core fears and motivations and deals with underlying emotions, all of which are essential to consider when trying to understand another person. The Enneagram has nine main personality types, so I decided on a name, 9 takes. "9" because of the 9 personality types, and "Takes" because there are different takes on the questions asked.

Additionally, I came to find out that the Enneagram had <a href="/blog/community/consensus-on-human-nature" >deep roots in philosophy and psychology</a> that were worth exploring.

So that was the inspiration for 9takes.
