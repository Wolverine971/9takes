<!-- ## Discover the Power of Nine Perspectives -->
<p class="firstLetter">Where are the good conversations happening online?<p>

Is there any place left where you can get multiple perspectives?

Most of the forums have devolved into echo chambers. The platforms have chosen sides. We need to go back to the early days when conversations were spontaneous and real and where you could be happily surprised by what you stumbled upon online.

9takes is trying to fix this.

## The Evolution of Social Media: From Fragmentation to Authentic Conversations

Over time, the internet has become increasingly fragmented, with once-vibrant platforms losing their spark and becoming overrun by bots and inauthentic interactions. The exciting conversations that used to define these spaces have been replaced by a dull, lifeless atmosphere. This raises the question: How did we get here, and what can we do to revitalize online discussions?

The creator of 9takes has observed the progression of social media and identified two distinct waves:

<section >
		<h3 style="margin: 0;">There are two social media waves.</h3>
		<section class="wave-sections" style="border: 1px solid grey;">
			<h4 style="margin-top: 0;">ü§ñ Old wave üîÑ</h4>

    				<p>
    					<b>"Social media"</b> was about being connected to your friends and finding cool stuff that
    					was shareable. That morphed into lurking and mindlessly scrolling, looking for cheap laughs
    					and dopamine bumps. We are now more divided than maybe ever, and depression is on the rise.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					<b>"Personality"</b> was supposed to be something fun an exciting. You could learn about
    					yourself and your friends. But it morphed into pseudoscience and a way to put people in boxes.
    					Yes, people are similar and different, but the conversation gets more complicated when you
    					bring up personality.
    				</p>
    			</section>


    			<section class="wave-sections" style="border: 1px solid #5407d9;">
    				<h4 style="margin-top: 0;">üé≠ New wave ‚ùì</h4>

    				<p>
    					<b>Social media</b> shouldn't feel stifling. It should be about self-expression and finding
    					and connecting with like-minded people. Different opinions make for different conversations,
    					not shutting people down. Social media should be the place to ask the big questions.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					<b>Personality</b> should be open ended. Discover your personality at your own pace. You
    					shouldn't be put in a box or told what you are. It should be fun and enlightening as you
    					learn your personality and should be driven by asking questions.
    				</p>
    			</section>
    			<p>And that's what 9takes. <b>Asking questions, building community, healing the globe</b> üåéüíó.</p>

## Comparing Platforms: 9takes vs. Reddit

9takes aims to improve upon the Reddit model by addressing three key issues:

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Moderator Dependence</h3>

- **Problem**: On Reddit, moderators have become gatekeepers of ideas rather than protectors of civil discourse.
- **Solution**: 9takes reduces the reliance on moderators by fostering a community-driven approach to content curation and moderation.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Subreddit Isolation</h3>

- **Problem**: Reddit's subreddits function as distinct conversation hubs, each with its own rules, leading to controlled but often insular discussion environments.
- **Solution**: 9takes has no gatekeepers of topics, only owners of questions. When a comment gets flagged the content gets moved to a separate section for flagged content.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Lurking Culture</h3>

- **Problem**: Reddit allows users to view comments without contributing, leading to a lurking culture that can dilute active engagement.
- **Solution**: On 9takes answers are revealed only after a user posts their unbiased opinion. Its a high bar but participation should be a habbit.

By tackling these issues head-on, 9takes aims to create a more engaging, diverse, and intellectually stimulating environment for online conversations.

## The Power of Questions in Unlocking Knowledge

At the core of 9takes is an emphasis on questions. This is a significant departure from the traditional model of passive content consumption.

The power of a question-centered approach lies in its ability to:

- **Spark Curiosity**: Questions have an innate ability to pique our interest and motivate us to explore new ideas and perspectives.
- **Encourage Reflection**: By prompting users to consider their own thoughts and experiences before engaging with others, questions foster introspection and self-discovery.
- **Facilitate Meaningful Interactions**: When users come together to share their insights and learn from one another, they form genuine connections based on shared interests and mutual understanding.

By focusing on questions where participation is required a new habbit is being formed where users learn, grow, and connect with others, ultimately redefining how we interact online.

Questions drive the quest for knowledge on the internet, prompting us to seek answers to the who, what, where, when, and how that pique our curiosity.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Exploring the Limitations of Existing Platforms</h3>

But what about all the other places people go to get their questions answered?

**Google**: As a search engine, Google aims to provide precise answers based on user queries. However, its effectiveness can be limited by its reliance on algorithms to interpret the underlying questions and surface relevant data. This approach may not always yield accurate or comprehensive results, particularly for complex or nuanced inquiries..

**Reddit**: We already talked about the limitations of subreddits. While these communities offer focused discussions, they also have their own rules and cultures, which can be challenging for newcomers to navigate. Finding the right subreddit to ask a question isn't always straightforward, and the quality of responses can vary widely.

**ChatGPT**: Large language models like ChatGPT offer another avenue for answering questions, drawing upon vast datasets that include information from various sources, such as Google and Reddit. While these models have improved in terms of creativity and accuracy, their responses are ultimately shaped by the data they were trained on, which can limit their originality and ability to provide novel insights.

While each of these platforms has its strengths in delivering factual responses, they may fall short when it comes to addressing creative or nuanced inquiries that don't have a single, clear-cut answer. This is where 9takes differentiates itself, focusing on exploring questions that inspire diverse perspectives and spark meaningful discussions.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">The questions that are ideal for 9takes</h3>

9takes is designed to delve into the myriad viewpoints and insights that a diverse community can offer. The platform recognizes that some of the most thought-provoking questions are those that encourage debate, reflection, and further questioning, rather than simply yielding a straightforward answer.

Consider the following examples, each posing a question that invites a wide range of responses, reflecting personal experiences, beliefs, and values:

- <a href="https://9takes.com/questions/something-going-change-yourself">What is something about yourself that is never going to change?</a>
- What is the best way to balance work and personal life?
- How do you feel about online learning and its effectiveness?
- What is the best educational system?
- How should I approach getting a girlfriend?
- How are you balancing caring for kids and aging parents?
- What does it mean to lead a good life?
- How have your relationships changed over time, and why is that?
- How do you show someone you are interested in them?

These questions highlight the essence of 9takes: a platform that thrives on the diversity of thought and the richness of shared experiences. It's not just about finding answers; it's about exploring the depths of human inquiry and connecting over the stories and ideas that make us uniquely human.

### Unique Answer Visibility on 9takes

9takes has a distinctive feature where answers to questions become visible only after you‚Äôve posted your response. This design ensures that your contribution is free from bias and influence from others‚Äô opinions. The goal is to encourage authenticity and originality in your answers, allowing you to express your thoughts and perspectives without being swayed by the crowd. This approach fosters diverse responses, each reflecting the individual‚Äôs genuine viewpoint.

### The Importance of Anonymity on 9takes

9takes ensures user anonymity to promote openness and sincerity in discussions. This anonymity allows users to share their genuine thoughts, feelings, and opinions without the concern of affecting their public image or personal brand. By removing the pressure to curate responses for social approval, users are encouraged to provide honest, unfiltered insights.

### The Role of Personality in User Identification

On 9takes, users are uniquely identified by their personality type, specifically through the Enneagram system. This approach combines insights from psychology and philosophy to create a framework for understanding human behavior and interaction.

**Why Use Personality as a Marker?** The idea is that individuals with the same Enneagram type tend to view the world through a similar lens, providing a basis for meaningful comparisons and discussions. When users of the same personality type answer a question, the responses might have underlying similarities. In contrast, answers from diverse personality types introduce a broad spectrum of perspectives, enriching the conversation. This method ensures that even when multiple users respond to the same prompt, their varied viewpoints broaden the collective insight, highlighting the importance of diversity in fostering comprehensive discussions.

## 9takes allows for nuance

In a world where absolutes and fact-checking, we forget that many of the things we are searching for don‚Äôt have black-and-white answers. 9takes invites users to explore different takes on questions because there is more than one perspective. There is a kaleidoscope of different takes and diamonds in the rough waiting to be uncovered.

<!-- But most of our time on the internet is spent searching for the answers to our
However all  -->

<!-- the first step for doing everything. Determining that the world revolved around the sun started out by questioning the status quo

When we search something on google, yes we often type in phrases, but we are asking a questions and looking for answers. "Where is this, how do I that, what is the best blank..." Google tries to serve you something accurate. But that accuracy is based on inferring the underlying question and matching it to statistically relevant data it already has. There is a lot of room for error in that equation and there is so much information that Google doen -->
<!--
Through the prism of the Enneagram's nine unique archetypes, 9takes fosters a dynamic and diverse community that values the richness of individual perspectives. It upholds the idea that every question has not one but many answers, each uniquely tinted by the personality of the respondent.

9takes takes us beyond the binary, into a realm where conversations blossom with authentic voices, unbiased by the opinions of others. Where we can see and appreciate the patterns and divergences in how different personality types approach the same question. In this beautifully intricate tapestry of human connection, every thread matters, every 'take' counts.

Through 9takes, we delve into the nuanced world of human psychology, fostering mutual understanding, inviting personal growth, and cultivating a deeper sense of community. Indeed, it's more than a platform - it's a kaleidoscope of the human experience, each 'take' adding a new dimension to our collective understanding.

Join us on 9takes, where we celebrate the beauty of nuance in every conversation.

Embracing Authenticity: Encouraging Unbiased Responses
Setting 9takes apart is its novel approach to comment visibility. Until you add your voice to the conversation, the thoughts of others remain unseen, encouraging unbiased and authentic responses. In contrast to the echo chambers of many platforms, this innovation prompts users to actively contribute their own unique perspective before exploring the voices of others.

Delving into the Enneagram: Sorting Insights by Personality Type
The second unique facet of 9takes is drawn from the Enneagram's fascinating design - nine distinct personality archetypes. The platform lets you sift through comments filtered by these types, revealing intriguing patterns in thought and behavior. This feature enables connections with those who share similar perspectives while fostering a greater understanding of different viewpoints, reinforcing the sense of an open-minded community.

Harnessing the Power of Nine: 9takes in Today‚Äôs Polarized World
9takes takes its name from the Enneagram's nine archetypes, symbolizing the nine perspectives the platform welcomes. In a world torn between right or wrong, us or them, 9takes heralds a unique space for sincere and growth-oriented conversation. Here, no single perspective holds the monopoly of truth - only a spectrum of 'takes' on life's intriguing questions. -->
