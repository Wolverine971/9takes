<!-- ## Discover the Power of Nine Perspectives -->
<p class="firstLetter">Where are the good conversations happening online? Are there any authentic conversations happening? Many discussions and forums devolve into echo chambers where people have to pick sides or silently accept the dominant culture.<p>

9takes is trying to solve this problem.

The closest comparison to 9takes would be <span style="text-shadow: .5px .5px #E0373C;">reddit</span>. Reddit is centered around subreddits, with moderators forming separate cultures and rules for each subreddit. People post random things, and the mods determine if the post is on topic and if the comments within the post are in keeping with the subreddit's culture. This system works well for niche subreddits with very few members and bot armies wanting to get a message across.

Reddit has two main problems:

- First, the subreddits are arbitrary. They are topics of conversation that have gatekeepers. While this does help the subreddit stay on topic, it also stifles potential conversation.
- The second is that users can passively see the comments without participating. This allows lurkers and bots to roam freely.

What if we had a different model?

- What if we had questions instead of random posts?
- And what if you could only see the answers to the questions once you post?

## Questions unlock everything

At a high level, questions are why people are on the internet. "Who is blank? What is blank? Where is blank? When is blank? How does blank?"

**Google** tries to serve you something accurate based on your search terms. But that accuracy is based on inferring the underlying question and matching it statistically to the data it has determined is relevant or the data that someone is paying you to see. That equation has much room for error, which is why people have been going to Reddit.

**Reddit** has a bunch of posts, but it also can provide you with answers to your questions. The trick with Reddit is finding the right subreddit to ask you questions. As mentioned, these subreddits have subcultures, and beginners and outsiders often do not receive a warm welcome. Hopefully, someone has asked a question relevant to your question, or you can lurk and find a conversation mentioning your search term.

**ChatGPT** and large language models have answered your questions well. The only catch is that the model has been trained on Google and Reddit data. Its ability to be creative and original is limited to the data it was introduced on. However, the LLMs are getting better every day. One day, an AI agent can answer all your questions.

There are many ways to get answers to your questions. But most of these options are tailored to give you the most accurate answer. There is a difference between wanting correct answers and wanting creative answers. If you are looking for a singular, more precise answer, go to one of the above or go to Quora (lol). But you need something else if you are looking for a creative answer.

Many of the most important questions have a different answer. Many questions require diverse perspectives and insightful opinions, and great questions give birth to more questions and trains of thought. The purpose of 9takes is to flesh out these unexplored questions and trains of thought.

Do the following questions have one correct answer?

- [What is something about yourself that is never going to change](https://9takes.com/questions/something-going-change-yourself)
- What is the best way to balance work and personal life?
- How do you feel about online learning and its effectiveness?
- What is the best educational system?
- How should I approach getting a girlfriend?
- How are you balancing caring for kids and aging parents?
- What does it mean to lead a good life?
- How have your relationships changed over time, and why is that?
- How do you show someone you are interested in them?

Questions can be anything from simple to complex, timeless to basic. We are all searching for answers to our questions.

## Back to what makes 9takes different

### Why can you only see the answers to the questions once you post?

This is because your answer will be biased if you can see what everyone else said before you answer. To provide an authentic and original answer to a question, you shouldn't be influenced by what everyone else says; you should be yourself. Give your take, different from what you think is the proper, funny, or nice take.

### Why are users anonymous?

Users are anonymous so that they can be honest about their true thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Users shouldn't worry about their brand when answering a question. Just give your honest take.

### What do you mean a user is identified by their personality?

Your selected "personality" is displayed next to your answer when you answer a question. The personality system 9takes uses is the Enneagram. The Enneagram is a personality system where human psychology and philosophy meet, and there are many reasons why it has been selected as the preferred personality system.

**But why does their personality identify users?** People of the same personality or Enneagram type will see the world similarly. This presents an opportunity to distinguish between similar and different perspectives or takes on a question. If ten people of the same personality type answer a question, you will not get a few new perspectives because they are all the same personality. However, if ten people of different personalities answer the question, you will have significant differences in perspectives. Even if ten people answer the same question, it will be interesting. Theoretically, there will be some common thread between people of the same personality types, but the variations are essential.

## 9takes allows for nuance

In a world where absolutes and fact-checking, we forget that many of the things we are searching for don't have black-and-white answers. 9takes invites users to explore different takes on questions because there is more than one perspective. There is a kaleidoscope of different takes and diamonds in the rough waiting to be uncovered.

<!-- But most of our time on the internet is spent searching for the answers to our

<!-- the first step for doing everything. Determining that the world revolved around the sun started out by questioning the status quo

When we search something on google, yes we often type in phrases, but we are asking a questions and looking for answers. "Where is this, how do I that, what is the best blank..." Google tries to serve you something accurate. But that accuracy is based on inferring the underlying question and matching it to statistically relevant data it already has. There is a lot of room for error in that equation and there is so much information that Google doen -->

Through the prism of the Enneagram's nine unique archetypes, 9takes fosters a dynamic and diverse community that values the richness of individual perspectives. It upholds the idea that every question has not one but many answers, each uniquely tinted by the personality of the respondent.

9takes takes us beyond the binary, into a realm where conversations blossom with authentic voices, unbiased by the opinions of others. Where we can see and appreciate the patterns and divergences in how different personality types approach the same question. In this beautifully intricate tapestry of human connection, every thread matters, every 'take' counts.

Through 9takes, we delve into the nuanced world of human psychology, fostering mutual understanding, inviting personal growth, and cultivating a deeper sense of community. Indeed, it's more than a platform - it's a kaleidoscope of the human experience, each 'take' adding a new dimension to our collective understanding.

Join us on 9takes, where we celebrate the beauty of nuance in every conversation.

Embracing Authenticity: Encouraging Unbiased Responses
Setting 9takes apart is its novel approach to comment visibility. Until you add your voice to the conversation, the thoughts of others remain unseen, encouraging unbiased and authentic responses. In contrast to the echo chambers of many platforms, this innovation prompts users to actively contribute their own unique perspective before exploring the voices of others.

Delving into the Enneagram: Sorting Insights by Personality Type
The second unique facet of 9takes is drawn from the Enneagram's fascinating design - nine distinct personality archetypes. The platform lets you sift through comments filtered by these types, revealing intriguing patterns in thought and behavior. This feature enables connections with those who share similar perspectives while fostering a greater understanding of different viewpoints, reinforcing the sense of an open-minded community.

Harnessing the Power of Nine: 9takes in Todayâ€™s Polarized World
9takes takes its name from the Enneagram's nine archetypes, symbolizing the nine perspectives the platform welcomes. In a world torn between right or wrong, us or them, 9takes heralds a unique space for sincere and growth-oriented conversation. Here, no single perspective holds the monopoly of truth - only a spectrum of 'takes' on life's intriguing questions. -->
