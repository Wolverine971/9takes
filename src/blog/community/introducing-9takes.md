<!-- ## Discover the Power of Nine Perspectives -->
<p class="firstLetter">Where are the good conversations happening online?<p>

Is there any place left where you can get multiple perspectives?

Most of the forums have devolved into echo chambers. The platforms have chosen sides. We need to go back to the early days when conversations were unfiltered, real and where you could be happily surprised by what you stumbled upon online.

9takes is fixing the problem of echo chambers.

## The Evolution of Social Media

Over time, the internet has become increasingly fragmented. The once vibrant platforms have lost their spark and have become filled with bots and inauthentic interactions. The exciting conversations that used to define these spaces have been replaced by a dull, lifeless atmosphere. How did we get here, and what can we do to fix online discussions?

<div>
	<h3 style="margin: 0;">There are two social media waves.</h3>
	<section class="wave-sections" style="border: 1px solid grey;">
		<h4 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">ü§ñ Old wave üîÑ</h4>
		<p><b>The old social media</b> was about being connected to your friends and finding cool stuff that was shareable. </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Users post to show off.</li>
		<li>Sharing turned into posting into the void.</li>
		<li>Viewing free content turned into lurking and mindlessly scrolling.</li>
		<li>Content converged, and the different viewpoints were pushed out.</li>
		</ul>
		We are now more divided than ever, and depression is on the rise.

		<h4 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">üé≠ New wave ‚ùì</h4>

		</ul>
		<p>New social media is about novelty and engagement.</p>

	<p>Belonging and exploring starts with asking <b>questions</b>.</p>

## The Power of Questions

<!-- //fix knowledge -->

At the core of 9takes is an emphasis on asking questions. Questions invite responses, while posts and tweets do not.

A question-centered approach can:

- **Spark Curiosity**: Questions have an innate ability to pique our interest and motivate us to explore new ideas and perspectives.
- **Encourage Reflection**: Questions prompt reflection. They unearth the stories and experiences that make us who we are.
- **Create Meaningful Interactions**: After a question is asked the conversation can start. The similarities and differences come out and seeds of connection are planted.

You are not shouting into the void with questions but are inviting people in.

<!-- old social media was about protecting institutions
new social media is about tearing institutions down -->

<!-- =-------break -->

### The Problems with Answers to Questions:

There are a few problems with just asking a question online. You are not guaranteed to get good responses to a question for the following reasons.

<!-- put link here -->

- You want an original take/ answer to a question.
- You don't want people answering to be biased by other people who have already answered.
- You want people to be honest and feel safe to share their real opinions.
- You want to be able to understand where people are coming from when they answer a question.

## Questions Get the Conversation Going

<!-- Put your offline questions online -->

In a world obsessed with absolutes and fact-checking, we often forget that many of the things we search for lack black-and-white answers. People are not math problems we can solve; they are universes we must explore. A kaleidoscope of different perspectives exists for every question, each one concealing hidden truths and untold stories waiting for us to uncover them. Take your offline questions and post them online‚Äîyou might be surprised by what you discover.

<!-- But most of our time on the internet is spent searching for the answers to our
However all  -->

<!-- the first step for doing everything. Determining that the world revolved around the sun started out by questioning the status quo

When we search something on google, yes we often type in phrases, but we are asking a questions and looking for answers. "Where is this, how do I that, what is the best blank..." Google tries to serve you something accurate. But that accuracy is based on inferring the underlying question and matching it to statistically relevant data it already has. There is a lot of room for error in that equation and there is so much information that Google doen -->
<!--
Through the prism of the Enneagram's nine unique archetypes, 9takes fosters a dynamic and diverse community that values the richness of individual perspectives. It upholds the idea that every question has not one but many answers, each uniquely tinted by the personality of the respondent.

9takes takes us beyond the binary, into a realm where conversations blossom with authentic voices, unbiased by the opinions of others. Where we can see and appreciate the patterns and divergences in how different personality types approach the same question. In this beautifully intricate tapestry of human connection, every thread matters, every 'take' counts.

Through 9takes, we delve into the nuanced world of human psychology, fostering mutual understanding, inviting personal growth, and cultivating a deeper sense of community. Indeed, it's more than a platform - it's a kaleidoscope of the human experience, each 'take' adding a new dimension to our collective understanding.

Join us on 9takes, where we celebrate the beauty of nuance in every conversation.

Embracing Authenticity: Encouraging Unbiased Responses
Setting 9takes apart is its novel approach to comment visibility. Until you add your voice to the conversation, the thoughts of others remain unseen, encouraging unbiased and authentic responses. In contrast to the echo chambers of many platforms, this innovation prompts users to actively contribute their own unique perspective before exploring the voices of others.

Delving into the Enneagram: Sorting Insights by Personality Type
The second unique facet of 9takes is drawn from the Enneagram's fascinating design - nine distinct personality archetypes. The platform lets you sift through comments filtered by these types, revealing intriguing patterns in thought and behavior. This feature enables connections with those who share similar perspectives while fostering a greater understanding of different viewpoints, reinforcing the sense of an open-minded community.

Harnessing the Power of Nine: 9takes in Today‚Äôs Polarized World
9takes takes its name from the Enneagram's nine archetypes, symbolizing the nine perspectives the platform welcomes. In a world torn between right or wrong, us or them, 9takes heralds a unique space for sincere and growth-oriented conversation. Here, no single perspective holds the monopoly of truth - only a spectrum of 'takes' on life's intriguing questions. -->
