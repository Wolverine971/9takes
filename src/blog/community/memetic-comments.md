Online discussions are not for the faint of heart. They are little battlegrounds where ideologies duke it out. You are either 'for' or 'against' whatever the topic. This polarizing dynamic fosters mimicry or memetic behavior. We copy the people we like and look up to.

<!-- breaking the memetic hold, say something nice about someone you disagree with -->

<!-- Maybe someone we like supports X, so we  -->

 <!-- or conflict rather than constructive conversations. Comments on forums often turn memetic. They spread fast, fueling anger and hostility in digital realms. A key factor here is seeing others' comments before adding our own. This post explores how this visibility shapes our responses, often limiting diverse perspectives in online debates. -->

## Understanding the Memetic Effect

People often mirror the beliefs of those they admire.

If someone respects beliefs in 'X,' their admirers are more likely to also believe in 'X' because they have been influenced by the person they admire rather than independent analysis. Similarly, when two people agree on one opinion, they're more open to each other's other views. This is known as mirroring, or, as Rene Girard would say, this is a memetic effect.

René Girard's concept of mimesis centers on the idea that human desires, interests, and behaviors are imitated mainly from others rather than originating independently. In Girard's view, we are intrinsically inclined to mimic the desires of those around us, especially individuals we perceive as models or figures of authority. This mimetic desire can lead to harmonious and conflicting relationships, as it not only involves emulating positive traits but can also result in rivalry and competition for the same objectives or status.

### Mimesis Online

In the online world, this mimetic behavior becomes even more pronounced.

With its blend of anonymity and impulsivity, the internet acts as a fertile ground for the rapid spread of opinions.

Individuals often mirror the perspectives they encounter online, particularly in comment sections where the first few opinions can disproportionately influence subsequent readers. This contributes to the formation of echo chambers, where a single viewpoint is amplified, and contrasting perspectives are minimized. In such an environment, discussions that could be rich and diverse are often simplified into binary arguments.

<!-- To counteract this trend, it's crucial to foster a culture that values diverse opinions and encourages critical thinking, moving beyond the initial reactions that are so easily mimicked online. -->

<!-- ## René Girard and Online Echo Chambers

The term 'memetic' comes from René Girard's memetic theory. It suggests that our desires and behaviors are often copied from others, leading to rivalry and conflict. Furthermore, we are often unaware of what or whom we are copying. This theory can be seen in online forums. Comments often imitate popular or provocative opinions, creating similar responses. People are not saying original and authentic things. They are copying the opinions of the people they want to imitate.

This only compounds when a person can see other people's comments. Rather than participating in the conversation, they choose who they want to imitate and who they want to be against. -->

## Anti-memetic Online Conversations

How can we replace these impulse reactions with genuine curiosity and open-mindedness? How can we take advantage of diverse opinions where readers are challenged to think critically?

**Give your opinion before you see other people's views.** Lurking wasn't always a thing. Comments should be hidden before you comment. This would encourage independent thought and curb the memetic trend in online interactions. 9takes does this.

**Questions > Hot takes**. "Hot takes" or posts do not solicit feedback. Unless someone specifically asks you to write something, posting something online can feel like shouting into the void. Plus, posts or hot takes create a binary situation where you agree or disagree. Questions invite responses and open the door to learning something new. [Check out the questions asked on 9takes](/questions).

Refocusing on respectful engagement and diverse perspectives can rejuvenate online discourse, enhancing mutual understanding.

The negative effects of mimetics can be stopped. And that is what 9takes is here to do.
