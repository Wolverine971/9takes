<p class="firstLetter">You've never had an original opinion in the comments section. Neither have I.</p>

Not really.

By the time you type your response, you've already been infected by the first three comments you read. Their framing became your framing. Their tone shaped your tone. Their hot take became the lens through which you processed the whole thread.

**This is mimesis in action** — and it's killing authentic discourse online.

<!-- Maybe someone we like supports X, so we  -->

 <!-- or conflict rather than constructive conversations. Comments on forums often turn memetic. They spread fast, fueling anger and hostility in digital realms. A key factor here is seeing others' comments before adding our own. This post explores how this visibility shapes our responses, often limiting diverse perspectives in online debates. -->

## Understanding the Memetic Effect

People often mirror the beliefs of those they admire.

If someone respects beliefs in 'X,' their admirers are more likely to also believe in 'X' because they have been influenced by the person they admire rather than independent analysis. Similarly, when two people agree on one opinion, they're more open to each other's other views. This is known as mirroring, or, as Rene Girard would say, this is a memetic effect.

René Girard's concept of mimesis centers on the idea that human desires, interests, and behaviors are imitated mainly from others rather than originating independently. In Girard's view, we are intrinsically inclined to mimic the desires of those around us, especially individuals we perceive as models or figures of authority. This mimetic desire can lead to harmonious and conflicting relationships, as it not only involves emulating positive traits but can also result in rivalry and competition for the same objectives or status.

### Mimesis Online

In the online world, this mimetic behavior becomes even more pronounced.

With its blend of anonymity and impulsivity, the internet acts as a fertile ground for the rapid spread of opinions.

Individuals often mirror the perspectives they encounter online, particularly in comment sections where the first few opinions can disproportionately influence subsequent readers. This contributes to the formation of echo chambers, where a single viewpoint is amplified, and contrasting perspectives are minimized. In such an environment, discussions that could be rich and diverse are often simplified into binary arguments.

<!-- To counteract this trend, it's crucial to foster a culture that values diverse opinions and encourages critical thinking, moving beyond the initial reactions that are so easily mimicked online. -->

<!-- ## René Girard and Online Echo Chambers

The term 'memetic' comes from René Girard's memetic theory. It suggests that our desires and behaviors are often copied from others, leading to rivalry and conflict. Furthermore, we are often unaware of what or whom we are copying. This theory can be seen in online forums. Comments often imitate popular or provocative opinions, creating similar responses. People are not saying original and authentic things. They are copying the opinions of the people they want to imitate.

This only compounds when a person can see other people's comments. Rather than participating in the conversation, they choose who they want to imitate and who they want to be against. -->

## Breaking the Mimetic Loop

How do you have an original thought online when the infrastructure is designed to prevent it?

**1. Respond before you read.** Lurking poisons authenticity. On 9takes, comments are hidden until you submit your own take. No priming. No copying. Just you and the question.

**2. Ask questions instead of making statements.** Hot takes create binary reactions — agree or disagree. Questions invite exploration. They bypass the memetic reflex because there's no position to copy yet. [Check out the questions asked on 9takes](/questions).

**3. Understand why people think differently.** When you learn [how each personality type processes information](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-communication-styles) and [handles stress](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-in-stress), you stop seeing disagreement as tribal warfare and start seeing it as different operating systems running different code.

[Reddit's structure](/community/reddit-deep-connections-limitations) amplifies mimesis — whoever comments first sets the frame for everyone else. The algorithm rewards speed, not depth.

**9takes inverts the model.** Speak first. Explore after. Think independently by design.

The mimetic loop can be broken. But not on platforms built to sustain it.
