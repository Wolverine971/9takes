Are you for or against something? That is how many online discussions devolve. Discussions devolve into binary yesses and noes. And you have to choose sides. 

Comments pile on either side of an issue and the temperature of the disagreement gets raised.

It is said that anger spreads quickly when people don't know each other. And online forums are the perfect breeding grounds for anger and hate to grow stronger. 

One thing that exacerbates the issues is that people can see what everyone is saying before they comment. They choose what opinions or takes on a topic they like and don't like without giving their own first. In this, they are being primed to fight and 

Furthermore, this often prematurely reduces the topic or discussion to binary fights. There are many angles on a topic, and many remain hidden while the people debating take up oxygen in the thread. People should be able to hear all sides of an argument on a topic before "sides" are created, and lines in the sand are drawn.

To nip this in the bud. It would help if you asked questions. And it would help if you did not see the comments before you comment.
