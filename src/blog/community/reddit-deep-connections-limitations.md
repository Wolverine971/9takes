<p class="firstLetter">You've scrolled r/relationship_advice at 2 AM looking for connection. You found 47 comments telling someone to "lawyer up" and a bot.</p>

Reddit has communities for everything. Deep connection isn't one of them.

Here's why — and it's not Reddit's fault. It's by design.

## 1. Surface-Level Interactions

**Reddit rewards speed, not depth.**

Quick comments get upvotes. Thoughtful 500-word responses get buried. The algorithm doesn't care if your insight changed someone's life — it cares if it was first.

You share something meaningful about a book that shaped your worldview. Someone replies "lol same." 47 upvotes. Your comment? 3 upvotes and silence.

**The format optimizes for engagement, not connection.**

## 2. The Anonymity Paradox

**Anonymity gives you freedom to share. It also makes sharing meaningless.**

You pour your heart out about your divorce. Strangers offer support. It feels good for 10 minutes. Then they're gone forever — and you're still alone with your pain.

There's no follow-up. No "how are you doing now?" No relationship that survives past the thread.

**You got acknowledged. You didn't get connected.**

## 3. Topics Over People

**You know their opinions. You don't know them.**

r/meditation has 2 million subscribers. You've probably interacted with hundreds of them. How many do you actually know? Not their meditation technique — them. Their fears. Their story. What meditation actually means in their life.

**Zero.** Because Reddit optimizes for content, not context.

Sharing an interest isn't sharing a life.

## 4. Echo Chambers Kill Growth

**Agreement feels like connection. It isn't.**

Everyone in your subreddit thinks the same way. It feels validating. It also means you're never challenged. You're never surprised by someone who sees things completely differently — and forces you to grow.

Real connection requires friction. Reddit's structure removes it.

Even when friction shows up, Reddit rewards performative dunking, not understanding. If you're stuck in comment wars, here’s [what winning online arguments looks like](/community/what-winning-online-arguments-looks-like).

Add the memetic effect (everyone copying the first few comments) and you get sameness disguised as debate—see [Echoes Online: The Power of Memetic Comments](/community/memetic-comments).

And underneath it all, subreddits are governed by unpaid moderators with their own psychology—see [why Type 1s become Reddit mods](/pop-culture/reddit-moderators-type-1-internet).

**You're not in community. You're in a feedback loop.**

## 5. No Continuity, No Connection

**By the time you want to follow up, the moment is gone.**

You had a real exchange with someone. Deep, thoughtful, meaningful. You want to build on it.

Too late. The thread is archived. They've moved on. The algorithm has already served them 47 new posts. Your moment together? Buried in their history, never to be revisited.

**Relationships require continuity. Reddit's design prevents it.**

## The Alternative

Reddit isn't broken. It's doing exactly what it was designed to do: surface content at scale.

But if you're craving actual connection — not just engagement, not just acknowledgment, but the kind of understanding that comes from knowing _why_ someone thinks what they think...

That requires a different structure. One that prioritizes the person behind the opinion. One that shows you [how different personality types communicate](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-communication-styles) so you can actually understand _why_ someone sees things differently.

<!-- ## Comparing Platforms: 9takes vs. Reddit

9takes aims to improve upon the Reddit model by addressing three key issues:

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Moderator Dependence</h3>

- **Problem**: On Reddit, moderators have become gatekeepers of ideas rather than protectors of civil discourse.
- **Solution**: 9takes reduces the reliance on moderators by fostering a community-driven approach to content curation and moderation.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Subreddit Isolation</h3>

- **Problem**: Reddit's subreddits function as distinct conversation hubs, each with its own rules, leading to controlled but often insular discussion environments.
- **Solution**: 9takes has no gatekeepers of topics, only owners of questions. When a comment gets flagged the content gets moved to a separate section for flagged content.

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Reddit's Lurking Culture</h3>

- **Problem**: Reddit allows users to view comments without contributing, leading to a lurking culture that can dilute active engagement.
- **Solution**: On 9takes answers are revealed only after a user posts their unbiased opinion. Its a high bar but participation should be a habbit.

By tackling these issues head-on, 9takes aims to create a more engaging, diverse, and intellectually stimulating environment for online conversations. -->
