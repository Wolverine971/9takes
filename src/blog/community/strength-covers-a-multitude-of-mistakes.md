As an 8 everything goes back to getting stronger.

That is kinda my first priority.

For other people being strong is their second or fifth priority.

They care about being happy before they care about being strong. But for me I can about being strong first and then I will be happy that I am strong or will be free to relax and be happy.

Some people need to feel safe, then they want to be strong. For me I want to be strong and then I will be safe.

Some people want to understand things before they want to get strong. For me I want to be strong, and then I will take the time to understand things.

Some people want to find love before they want to be strong. Me I want to be strong, and then find love.

Its hard for me to think about being weak and in any of those states....

Another way to view it

You could say that there are different problems that require different things and strength is only good for some types of problems. Actually no. In every situation if you were stronger than you could deal with the problem. Because you would have more energy more reserves to deal with the problem.

Say you want to go to mars. That is a thinking and engineering problem. Yes but inorder to maximize your engineering production everyone needs to be stronger. A team of fricken strong engineers will eventually be better than a team of smart engineers.
