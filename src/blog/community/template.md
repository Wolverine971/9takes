## Ideas For Blogs

- Need to heal or at least Political Divide
    - Decrease the polarization

- Technology changing communication
    - We communicate in smaller chunks loosing context

- Our research of Psychology parallels our research of computers
    - We saw writing software as trivial. We were focused on the power of computing.
    - We valued computers getting better, not people writing better software
    - We valued hardware and moores law
    - This is similar to psychology, we stop trying to understand what people were thinking and feeling
    - We focused on the hardware of the brain, better brain scanning, got distracted by edge cases aka treating disorders

- To throw a sick party
- To find my "tribe"
- To start a dialog with people unlike me
- 3 reasons we see broadly but fail to see deeply
