## Ideas For Blogs

- Need to heal or at least Political Divide

  - Decrease the polarization

- Technology changing communication

  - We communicate in smaller chunks loosing context

- Our research of Psychology parallels our research of computers

  - We saw writing software as trivial. We were focused on the power of computing.
  - We valued computers getting better, not people writing better software
  - We valued hardware and moores law
  - This is similar to psychology, we stop trying to understand what people were thinking and feeling
  - We focused on the hardware of the brain, better brain scanning, got distracted by edge cases aka treating disorders

- To throw a sick party
- To find my "tribe"
- To start a dialog with people unlike me
- 3 reasons we see broadly but fail to see deeply

[David Sacks from the All in Podcast ](https://youtu.be/qQ544sWC8ZQ?t=485) talking about the give to get strategy as a tactic to get people to share their data.
