Plato when talking about the human soul said we were made of three parts, reason, spirit and appetite. He errantly went on to try to match these forces to classes in society. Aristotle who came after him said that the human soul was made up of two parts, the rational part and the irrational part. 

Sigmund Freud said that the human psyche was divided up into three parts, the id, ego and super ego. He correctly identified that these forces pull upon our mind in different ways and whose effects can be seen through observing our behavior. In modern times psychologists like Steven Pinker decry the need for rationality because so much of what he sees is irrational.

However what if people were more complicated than simply being rational or irrational. What if Plato and Freud were right and Aristotle and Pinker didn't have the full picture. What if the people who don't agree with you were not good or bad or right or wrong. What if they just were looking at different things than you were. What if 

Given any issue or question what if the answers were not divided like a coin flip of being right or wrong, good or bad. What if answers were like an impossible three-sided die. 

The enneagram divides people by 3 things. Three emotions and three centers of intelligence. The three emotions are anger fear and shame. And the three centers of intelligence are Thinking, Feeling, and Instictive

## Introduction

Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and Pinker are all renowned for their insights into the human mind, but they differ significantly in their understanding of the human soul or psyche. This blog post will explore the theories of these influential thinkers and delve into the idea that perhaps, like a three-sided die, the human mind is more complex than simply being rational or irrational. We will consider the notion that people's beliefs and opinions may not always fall into binary categories like right or wrong, or good or bad, but instead, they are influenced by a myriad of factors that shape their unique perspectives.

## Sigmund Freud's Tripartite Model

Sigmund Freud revolutionized our understanding of the human psyche by suggesting that it was divided into three parts: the id, ego, and superego. Freud argued that these components interact in intricate ways, each influencing our thoughts, emotions, and behavior. The id represents our basic instincts and desires, the ego mediates between the id's demands and reality, and the superego is the internalized societal and parental standards. This complex interplay of forces can provide a more nuanced understanding of human behavior compared to Aristotle's simplistic division of rational and irrational.

## Steven Pinker's Critique of Rationality

Contemporary psychologist Steven Pinker has questioned the importance of rationality in human behavior, pointing out that much of what we observe in people's actions seems to be irrational. This perspective may be seen as an extension of Aristotle's theory, which posits that the irrational part of the soul is responsible for desires and emotions. However, Pinker's focus on irrationality may not present the complete picture of the human mind.

## The Three-Sided Die: Embracing Complexity

What if the human mind is more multifaceted than merely being rational or irrational, as suggested by Plato and Freud? The idea of a three-sided die represents the possibility that people's perspectives are shaped by various factors, making it difficult to categorize them as simply right or wrong, good or bad. This notion encourages us to consider that individuals might be looking at different aspects of an issue or question, rather than dismissing their views as fundamentally flawed.

## Conclusion

The theories of Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and Pinker each offer valuable insights into the workings of the human mind. While the concept of the three-sided die may not perfectly align with any one thinker's views, it emphasizes the importance of embracing the complexity of human thought and behavior. Recognizing that people's beliefs and opinions are shaped by a multitude of factors can foster empathy, understanding, and more constructive dialogues when addressing the challenges and questions we face in our world.
