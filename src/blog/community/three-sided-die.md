Plato when talking about the human soul said we were made of three parts, reason, spirit and appetite. He errantly went on to try to match these forces to classes in society. Aristotle who came after him said that the human soul was made up of two parts, the rational part and the irrational part.

Sigmund Freud said that the human psyche was divided up into three parts, the id, ego and superego. He correctly identified that these forces pull upon our mind in different ways and whose effects can be seen through observing our behavior. In modern times psychologists like Steven Pinker decry the need for rationality because so much of what he sees is irrational.

However what if people were more complicated than simply being rational or irrational. What if Plato and Freud were right and Aristotle and Pinker didn't have the full picture. What if the people who don't agree with you were not good or bad or right or wrong. What if they just were looking at different things than you were. What if

Given any issue or question what if the answers were not divided like a coin flip of being right or wrong, good or bad. What if answers were like an impossible three-sided die.

The enneagram divides people by 3 things. Three emotions and three centers of intelligence. The three emotions are anger, fear and shame. And the three centers of intelligence are Thinking, Feeling, and Instinctive

<!-- What is the consensus on human nature? It is TBD but there have been two main perspectives that keep coming up. The philosophers Plato and Aristotle had oposing view that mirror the phychologists Sigmund Freud view compared to modern psychologist Steven Pinker. Here we will explore these perspecives.

## Plato is to Aristotle as Freud is to Pinker

Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and the modern psychologist Steven Pinker are all renowned for their insights into the human mind, but they differ significantly in their understanding of human nature. Plato divided the psyche into three parts where as Aristotle divided the human psyche into the rational and the irrational. Similarly Freud had his three part division of the psyche, the id, ego and super ego, where as Pinker boils the psyche back down to the rational and the irratioal like Aristotle.

This blog post will explore the theories of these influential thinkers and delve into the idea that perhaps, like a three-sided die, the human mind is more complex than simply being rational or irrational. We will consider the notion that people's beliefs and opinions may not always fall into binary categories like right or wrong, or good or bad, but instead, they are influenced by a myriad of factors that shape their unique perspectives.

Though we see everything in 2d our brain knows there is more than the 2d visual that we see. There is something behind that 2d picture. There is depth that can be infered. The brain is aware of both the things we see and the things we do not see. The world is not flat, things are not binary, logical or illgical. There are other dimensions that are not easy to articulate.

## The Foundations: Plato and Aristotle

Plato, in his discourse on the human soul, proposed that it was composed of three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. He attempted to connect these aspects to the classes in society, which may have been a misguided effort. His student, Aristotle, believed that the human soul was made up of two parts: the rational and the irrational. He saw the irrational part as responsible for desires and emotions, while the rational part was in charge of reasoning and deliberation.

## Sigmund Freud's Tripartite Model

Sigmund Freud revolutionized our understanding of the human psyche by suggesting that it was divided into three parts: the id, ego, and superego. Freud argued that these components interact in intricate ways, each influencing our thoughts, emotions, and behavior. The id represents our basic instincts and desires, the ego mediates between the id's demands and reality, and the superego is the internalized societal and parental standards. This complex interplay of forces can provide a more nuanced understanding of human behavior compared to Aristotle's simplistic division of rational and irrational.

## Steven Pinker's Critique of Rationality

Professor of psychology Steven Pinker has questioned the importance of rationality in human behavior, pointing out that much of what we observe in people's actions seems to be irrational. He calls for people to simply be more rational and says that the more rational we are the more progress we attain. He goes on to list the many logical fallacies that people should avoid.

</div>

This perspective may be seen as an extension of Aristotle's theory, which posits that the irrational part of the soul is responsible for desires and emotions. Calling on people to be more rational and avoid logical fallacies isn't to move the needle. At the end of Pinker's interview he talks about how education often doesn't do the trick in making people more rational and he says that people need to just change and incorporate this into their daily lives. However, Pinker's call to remove irrationality may not be the solution we need.

## The Three-Sided Die: Embracing Complexity

What if the human mind is more multifaceted than merely being rational or irrational, as suggested by Plato and Freud? What if there were other forces at play? What if rationality was only part of the way we get to progress? What if the other pieces to progress were found in the other areas discussed by Freud and Plato: the id and superego or spirit and appetite? What if people are not simply rational or irrational, good or bad, right or wrong? The idea of a three-sided die represents the tension between figuring out what is the path to progress, what is going on in the human mind and what composes the human soul. People's perspectives are shaped by various factors, making it difficult to categorize them. This notion encourages us to consider that individuals might be looking at different aspects of an issue or question, rather than dismissing their views as fundamentally flawed.

## Conclusion

The theories of Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and Pinker each offer valuable insights into the workings of the human mind. While the concept of the three-sided die may not perfectly align with any one thinker's views, it emphasizes the importance of embracing the complexity of human thought and behavior. Recognizing that people's beliefs and opinions are shaped by a multitude of factors can foster empathy, understanding, and more constructive dialogues when addressing the challenges and questions we face in our world.
