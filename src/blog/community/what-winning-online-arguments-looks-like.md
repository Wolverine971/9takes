<!--

Part 1- To set the scene- no one really wins
each side walks away and goes further into their biases

If you prove your point and embarrass the other side- they aren't going to change their mind, they are going to dig in deeper.

There is no winning when you are trying to "win."
Your approach is wrong. You are spiteful. You want to be right.

Part 2- Redefine winning- Winning is about learning-
mindset should be about learning
accept influence to give influence
learn from the other side and really try to understand their perspective
There is a word for this, it is called steelmanning the other side

The news does not steelman the other side. They straw man the other side
Explain straw manning

Part 3- With that as the foundation, we are going to get into the tactics of how it can be done.

Biggest mistake people make in an argument is they want to be understood before they want to understand

1st step- change your mindset is mindset
- you are there to learn
- you should have done research and thought deeply about the other side's views so that you understand them
- you should think "How could a smart, reasonable, loving, and kind person who has real-life experience have these views?" and actually think about how they arrived at those views
- if you have properly steelmaned the other side you should be able to explain their point of view in such a way that they agree with it
-
2nd step- establish common ground
- Start by acknowledging points of agreement.

3rd step- be vulnerable
- admit you dont know everything
- admit you have feelings about these topics and you want to be understood

4th step- set the goal to be to learn
- you have questions that you would like answered
- you want to learn deeper why the other person thinks the way they do

Bonus step- lay out your perception of the other person's argument and ask them to correct you

<p class="firstLetter">You destroyed them in the comments.</p>

Perfect logic. Receipts. A devastating final line that left them with nothing to say.

You won. They went silent.

And absolutely nothing changed.

Here's what actually happened: they screenshot your reply, sent it to three friends, and spent the next hour crafting a mental case for why you're an idiot. By the time they closed the app, they believed their original position _more strongly_ than before.

You didn't win. You created an enemy and reinforced their beliefs.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Online Arguments

Nobody changes their mind at the end of an argument.

Not because people are stupid. Because that's not how persuasion works.

When you "win" publicly, you trigger fight-or-flight. The other person's brain stops processing your logic and starts defending their identity. Every point you score makes them dig in deeper.

If you embarrassed them? Now everyone who shares their views sees you as mean, heartless, and smug. You didn't just lose one potential convert. You lost anyone watching who leaned their direction.

## What Winning Actually Looks Like

Real winning? Both sides learn something. Both sides walk away thinking.

This requires a complete mindset flip. Instead of building the best case against them, you build the best case _for_ them. This is called **steel manning**.

**Steel manning** means representing the other side's argument in its strongest possible form. You steelman their position before you respond to it.

The opposite is **straw manning**, which is what cable news does 24/7. Take the weakest, dumbest version of the other side's argument, knock it down, and declare victory. Easy dopamine. Zero actual progress.

Steel manning is harder. It requires you to actually understand why smart, reasonable people might disagree with you.

But here's the tactical advantage: when you demonstrate that you _get_ their position, you earn the right to be heard. Walls come down. Defenses relax. Now you can actually have a conversation.

## The Tactical Playbook for Productive Online Arguments

Let's be honest: you probably can't have the conversation you want online. Text strips out tone, nuance, and humanity. The medium is stacked against you.

But sometimes you have to try. Here's how to give yourself the best shot.

The key insight: **seek to understand before you try to be understood.**

Most people do this backwards. They lead with their argument, then get frustrated when the other person doesn't listen. But why would they? You haven't shown any interest in their perspective.

Understanding [how different personality types communicate](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-communication-styles) gives you an even bigger edge. A Type 8 needs directness. A Type 2 needs to feel appreciated. A Type 5 needs space to think. Same argument, completely different approaches.

Here are 4 steps that actually work:

### Step 1: Flip Your Mindset From Combat to Curiosity

You're not here to preach. You're here to learn.

Before you type a single character, genuinely ask yourself: _How could a smart, reasonable person arrive at this view?_

Not "how could an idiot think this." Not "what's wrong with their logic." But: what life experiences, values, or information would lead someone to this conclusion?

This isn't about being soft. It's tactical. When you approach from genuine curiosity, you ask better questions, find real weak points, and avoid the emotional traps that derail conversations.

Once you've genuinely considered their angle, you're ready to engage.

### Step 2: Narrow the Battlefield

Most arguments are 90% agreement disguised as 100% disagreement.

Before attacking, map the common ground. Where do you actually agree? What values do you share? What facts are you both working from?

Then isolate the real point of contention. "So we both want X outcome. We both agree Y is a problem. The question is whether Z is the right solution. Is that fair?"

This does two things. First, it signals you're not trying to destroy them. Second, it focuses the conversation on the actual disagreement instead of shadow-boxing over misunderstandings.

### Step 3: Show Your Cards First

This feels counterintuitive, but vulnerability is a tactical advantage.

Admit what you don't know. Acknowledge where your position might be weak. Share _why_ this topic matters to you emotionally.

"I'll be honest, I'm not sure I have this figured out. This issue matters to me because [personal reason]. I'm genuinely trying to understand the other side better."

This transforms you from "opponent" to "human." It gives the other person permission to drop their guard too. Now you're two people trying to figure something out together, not two armies clashing.

Most people won't reciprocate. But the ones who do? Those are the conversations worth having.

### Step 4: Lead With a Question, Not an Accusation

Most people open with their argument. "Here's why you're wrong..."

The conversation is dead before it starts.

Instead, open with a genuine question. Not a gotcha question. Not a rhetorical trap. An actual question you want answered.

"I'm trying to understand something. When you say [their position], how do you think about [specific concern]? What am I missing?"

Good questions are specific, not broad. "Why do you believe that?" is lazy. "What experience led you to prioritize X over Y?" shows you've actually thought about their position.

This is a skill worth developing. The quality of your questions determines the quality of your conversations.

### Bonus: Invite Correction

This is the accelerant.

Lay out your understanding of their position and explicitly ask them to correct you: "Here's what I think you're saying... Am I getting that right? Where am I off?"

This does three things:

1. **It proves you've listened.** You can't summarize a position you haven't tried to understand.
2. **It invites collaboration.** Now they're helping you understand instead of defending against attack.
3. **It often reveals the real disagreement.** Half the time, the argument dissolves once you realize you were arguing past each other.

When someone takes time to correct your understanding of their view, you're not having an argument anymore. You're having a conversation.

## The Personality Factor

Here's one more layer: [different personality types process conflict completely differently](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-in-stress).

A Type 1 argues from principle. They need to feel the discussion is fair and rigorous.

A Type 8 argues from power. They respect directness and despise manipulation.

A Type 6 argues from anxiety. They're scanning for hidden agendas and need reassurance.

Same topic. Completely different emotional needs. The approach that works with one type will backfire with another.

## The Bottom Line

Winning an online argument isn't about proving your point.

It's about understanding the other person's position so well that you both walk away smarter. It's about being the person who brings curiosity instead of contempt. It's about recognizing that the real "win" is a conversation that changes how both of you think.

That's rare online. But it's possible.

And it starts with letting go of the need to be right.
