<QuickAnswer question="Why does 9takes use Greek-inspired design?">
**Because the Greeks invented the technology for meaningful public discourse—and we've lost it.** The agora and academy weren't just places to gather; they were engineered for Socratic dialogue, where questions led to deeper questions, and multiple perspectives were expected. Modern social media optimizes for engagement, not understanding. 9takes brings back the Greek method: ask questions, hear multiple viewpoints (9 personality-based takes), and think through answers rather than react to them.
</QuickAnswer>

<p class="firstLetter">Ancient Greece was ahead of its time. They had the world's first Democracy. They came up with Philosophy. They built a working plumbing system and many of their buildings still remain standing today ~ 2000 years later.</p>

The Greeks formed many aspects of western thought. However today we don't have a place to follow one of their most important practices. And that is openly talking about philosophy through asking questions. The Socratic method is sometimes still talked about in college classrooms but it remains an obscure relic from the past. We need to bring it back.

Plato used to ask open questions and talk through different trains of thought in the agora. The agora was the open marketplace where people congregated and ideas spread. Today we have Twitter and Reddit but open questions are not talked through like they were back in ancient Greece.

**9takes seeks to be the modern day agora where fundamental questions can be discussed openly.**

## What the Greeks Understood About Discourse

The ancient Greeks didn't just invent democracy—they invented the infrastructure for productive disagreement. They understood something we've forgotten: **you can't have good answers without good questions.**

The Socratic method wasn't about winning arguments. It was about:

- **Asking questions** rather than making statements
- **Exposing assumptions** that people didn't know they held
- **Following logic** wherever it led, even to uncomfortable conclusions
- **Recognizing multiple valid perspectives** on complex issues

Sound familiar? This is exactly what's missing from modern online discourse.

### Why Modern Social Media Fails at Discourse

Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook were designed for engagement, not understanding. They optimize for:

| Social Media Optimizes For | Greeks Optimized For |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Quick reactions            | Deep reflection      |
| Winning arguments          | Seeking truth        |
| Tribal identity            | Individual reasoning |
| Content consumption        | Idea exploration     |
| Algorithmic curation       | Personal inquiry     |

The result? We're more connected than ever but understand each other less than ever.

## The 9takes Philosophy: Built on Greek Principles

9takes draws directly from Greek philosophical principles:

### 1. Questions Before Answers

Like Socrates, we believe the quality of your questions determines the quality of your understanding. Every conversation on 9takes starts with a question, not a statement or opinion.

### 2. Multiple Perspectives by Design

The Greeks understood that truth often lies at the intersection of competing viewpoints. The "9 takes" in our name refers to the nine Enneagram personality types—each offering a distinct lens on any question. You don't just see one take, you see how different types of minds approach the same issue.

### 3. Think Before Reacting

The Greek academy required students to listen and consider before responding. On 9takes, you must submit your own answer before seeing what others have said. This prevents groupthink and ensures every voice is genuinely independent.

### 4. Anonymous Discourse

In the agora, ideas were debated on their merits, not based on who said them. 9takes allows anonymous participation, letting your thoughts stand independently of your identity, status, or follower count.

## Neoclassical inspiration

The term "neoclassical" is derived from the Greek words "neo," meaning new, and "klassikos," which refers to the classical art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome. Neoclassical design draws inspiration from these ancient civilizations' art, architecture, and philosophy, aiming to bring their timeless elegance and grandeur to contemporary settings.

<!-- If Socrates was alive today he would be flabbergasted by social media. So much potential just squandered.

9takes is what Socrates would have wanted. We honor Socrates and the great greek philosophers by displaying the things that they might have looked at during their time.

The greeks built stuff to last. It was ornate and detailed.  -->

## The Significance of Greek Iconography

The Greeks were builders as well as artists. Their structures were purposeful yet ornate. Meticulous details carried meaning, symbolizing virtues such as trust and honor.

For 9takes.com, the Greek aesthetic is something to look up to. It's a salute to the Greeks' visionary craftsmanship and a reminder of timeless values. Platforms that evoke trust and timelessness are invaluable in our fast-paced digital world.

In essence, 9takes.com melds the ancient and the modern. Embracing Greek iconography and philosophy ensures that age-old wisdom shines brightly in our digital age.

## Socrates in Today's Digital World

Were Socrates alive today, he'd likely be fascinated and dismayed by our digital era, especially the superficial nature of social media. Despite its vast potential for global communication, the depth of discourse often needs to be improved.

9takes aims to address this void. By weaving in Greek philosophy and iconography elements, it honors the profound insights of thinkers like Socrates. The platform harks back to an era where discourse was profound, ideas transformative, and the pursuit of knowledge was revered.

### What Socrates Would Have Loved About 9takes

1. **Questions that reveal character**: The Greeks believed character determined destiny. On 9takes, questions reveal different personality types' approaches to the same situation.

2. **No rushing to consensus**: Socrates was famously unpopular because he wouldn't let conversations end prematurely. 9takes doesn't have upvotes or popularity metrics that force conformity.

3. **Emotional honesty**: The Greeks studied pathos (emotion) alongside logos (logic). 9takes embraces that our emotional responses to questions are valid data, not noise to be eliminated.

## The Modern Agora: Building Digital Spaces for Real Discourse

The physical agora served multiple functions:

- **Marketplace of ideas**: Where new concepts were tested against scrutiny
- **Democratic space**: Where every citizen (albeit limited by their standards) had a voice
- **Learning environment**: Where students encountered diverse teachers
- **Community hub**: Where relationships formed through shared inquiry

9takes attempts to recreate these functions digitally:

| Agora Function   | 9takes Implementation                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Testing ideas    | Submit your take before seeing others                  |
| Democratic voice | Personality type tags level the field                  |
| Learning         | See how other types think about your question          |
| Community        | Connect through shared inquiry, not tribal affiliation |

## Why This Matters Now More Than Ever

We're living through a crisis of discourse. Social media has balkanized us into filter bubbles. Political polarization makes understanding "the other side" feel impossible. Nuance has become a liability.

The Greeks faced similar challenges. Athens was politically divided, foreign ideas threatened tradition, and populist demagogues gained power. Their solution? Institutions and practices designed to slow down thinking and expose people to different perspectives.

9takes represents an attempt to build that kind of institution for the digital age. Not as a replacement for existing platforms, but as a complement—a space specifically designed for the kind of thinking that other platforms accidentally discourage.

**The Greek aesthetic isn't just decoration. It's a reminder of what we're building toward.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does 9takes use Greek statues in its imagery?

Greek statues represent idealized human form—not because the Greeks ignored human flaws, but because they believed in human potential. The statues remind us that we're capable of deep thought, meaningful discourse, and understanding each other across differences. They're aspirational, pointing toward what conversation could be, not what it typically is on modern social media.

### What is the connection between Greek philosophy and personality types?

The Greeks pioneered systematic thinking about human temperament. Hippocrates' four humors (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic) were an early personality typology. The Enneagram, while not Greek in origin, continues this tradition of recognizing that humans have different fundamental orientations. 9takes uses the Enneagram to add a Greek-style systematic understanding of how different minds approach the same questions.

### How does 9takes bring back Socratic dialogue?

Three key ways: First, the platform is question-centered, not statement-centered—you start with inquiry, not assertion. Second, you must contribute your own answer before seeing others, preventing the groupthink that Socrates fought against. Third, seeing 9 different personality perspectives mirrors the Socratic practice of considering multiple viewpoints rather than accepting the first plausible answer.

### What would Socrates think of modern social media?

He'd probably be horrified—but also recognize the potential. Socrates was killed for "corrupting the youth" by teaching them to question authority. Social media has democratized information but not democratized wisdom. Socrates would likely appreciate platforms that slow down reaction and encourage reflection. He'd probably spend his time asking uncomfortable questions that got him banned from Twitter.

### Is 9takes trying to replace other social media?

No. 9takes serves a different purpose than Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok. Those platforms excel at entertainment, news distribution, and casual connection. 9takes is specifically designed for exploratory conversation—the kind where you're genuinely curious what other people think, not just looking to share your own take or consume content. Think of it as a complement, not a replacement.
