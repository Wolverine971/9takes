## Its called "neoclassical"

The term "neoclassical" is derived from the Greek words "neo," meaning new, and "klassikos," which refers to the classical art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome. Neoclassical design draws inspiration from these ancient civilizations' art, architecture, and philosophy, aiming to bring their timeless elegance and grandeur to contemporary settings.

<!-- If Socrates was alive today he would be flabbergasted by social media. So much potential just squandered.

9takes is what Socrates would have wanted. We honor Socrates and the great greek philosophers by displaying the things that they might have looked at during their time.

The greeks built stuff to last. It was ornate and detailed.  -->

## The Significance of Greek Iconography

The Greeks weren't just builders; they were artists. Their structures, ornate and purposeful, often paid tribute to their gods. Every meticulous detail carried meaning, symbolizing virtues such as trust and honor.

For 9takes.com, Greek iconography isn't merely aesthetic. It's a salute to the Greeks' visionary craftsmanship and a reminder of timeless values. Platforms that evoke trust and timelessness are invaluable in our fast-paced digital world.

In essence, 9takes.com melds the ancient and the modern. Embracing Greek iconography and philosophy ensures that age-old wisdom shines brightly in our digital age.

## Socrates in Today's Digital World

Were Socrates alive today, he'd likely be fascinated and dismayed by our digital era, especially the superficial nature of social media. Despite its vast potential for global communication, the depth of discourse often needs to be improved.

9takes aims to address this void. By weaving in Greek philosophy and iconography elements, it honors the profound insights of thinkers like Socrates. The platform harks back to an era where discourse was profound, ideas transformative, and the pursuit of knowledge was revered.
