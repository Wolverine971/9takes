<!-- // Understanding your place of comfort and stress and how yours stress number is the number that hate -->

<!-- You have a harder time interacting with enneagram types that are your stress number because you recognize the toxic parts of yourself in that enneagram type
Therefore its hard for you to be around people that are your stress number because it reminds you of yourself when you are not your best. -->
