<p class="firstLetter">You've been told personality is fixed. That you're stuck with who you are. That real change takes years of therapy. **Here's the truth: You can systematically upgrade your personality in 90 days.**</p>

Not through positive thinking. Not through generic self-help. But through a structured program that treats personality development like athletic training—with specific exercises, measurable progress, and type-specific protocols based on the Enneagram.

This isn't about becoming someone else. It's about becoming the highest-functioning version of your type. Think of it as going from personality 1.0 to personality 2.0 in three months.

> **The difference between who you are and who you could be is 90 days of deliberate practice.**

## Why 90 Days? The Science of Personality Change

Research from psychology shows that new neural pathways form in 21-66 days, but **true personality shifts require 90 days** of consistent practice to become automatic. Here's why:

- **Days 1-30:** Breaking unconscious patterns (awareness phase)
- **Days 31-60:** Building new neural highways (rewiring phase)  
- **Days 61-90:** Cementing changes into identity (integration phase)

Your brain literally rewires itself when you consistently practice new patterns. This isn't motivation—it's neuroscience.

## The Personality Maxing Method: Your Type-Specific Transformation

Traditional self-improvement fails because it's generic. The Enneagram reveals that each personality type needs completely different development strategies. A Type 8's growth plan would destroy a Type 9, and vice versa.

Here's your personalized 90-day blueprint based on your core type:

## FAQ: Your 90-Day Journey

**Q: What if I'm not sure of my type?**
Start with your best guess. The practices will actually help clarify your type as patterns become obvious.

**Q: Can I do multiple types if I relate to several?**
No. Focus on one core type. You can explore wings and connections after 90 days.

**Q: What if I miss days?**
Progress over perfection. Missing 1-2 days won't derail you. Missing a week will. Get back on immediately.

**Q: Is this like therapy?**
It's complementary to therapy but different. This is structured practice, not processing trauma. Do both if needed.

**Q: What if my type seems wrong after starting?**
Switch to correct type and restart count. Better to adjust than force wrong practices.

**Q: Can couples do this together?**
Absolutely! Parallel transformation accelerates both individual and relationship growth.
