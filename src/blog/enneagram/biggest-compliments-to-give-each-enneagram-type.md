## Quick Answer

**What compliments work best for each Enneagram type?** Compliment what they secretly fear they lack. Type 1s want to hear they're good (not just right). Type 2s need to feel loved for who they are, not what they give. Type 3s want genuine recognition beyond achievements. Type 4s crave being truly understood. Type 5s appreciate when their knowledge makes a difference. Type 6s need reassurance they can trust themselves. Type 7s want depth acknowledged beneath their fun exterior. Type 8s respect being seen as fair, not just strong. Type 9s need to know their voice matters.

## Compliment Cheat Sheet

| Type       | What They Fear        | Compliment That Lands                         | Avoid                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Type 1** | Being corrupt/bad     | "Your integrity inspires me"                  | "You're always right" (sounds sarcastic) |
| **Type 2** | Being unloved         | "I love you for who you are, not what you do" | "Thanks for helping" (too transactional) |
| **Type 3** | Being worthless       | "I admire the person behind the success"      | "You're so accomplished" (surface level) |
| **Type 4** | Being ordinary        | "Your perspective is unlike anyone's"         | "You're so unique" (feels dismissive)    |
| **Type 5** | Being incompetent     | "Your insight changed how I see this"         | "You're so smart" (too generic)          |
| **Type 6** | Being without support | "I trust your judgment completely"            | "Don't worry so much" (invalidating)     |
| **Type 7** | Being trapped in pain | "I see the depth beneath your energy"         | "You're so fun!" (misses the point)      |
| **Type 8** | Being controlled/hurt | "Your fairness inspires loyalty"              | "You're so strong" (expected)            |
| **Type 9** | Being insignificant   | "Your presence makes everything better"       | "You're so easy-going" (invisibilizing)  |

<p class="firstLetter">"You're so smart!" "You're so nice!" "Great job!"</p>

These compliments fall flat. They're generic, forgettable, and don't make anyone feel truly seen.

The secret to meaningful compliments? **Acknowledge what they secretly fear they lack.** Each Enneagram type has a core fear—and when you affirm the opposite of that fear, you touch something deep.

<article class="section-content">

### Type 1: The Perfectionist

**Core fear:** Being corrupt, bad, or morally flawed

Type 1s have a relentless inner critic constantly telling them they're not good enough. They strive for perfection because they genuinely want to be good people.

**Say this:** "Your integrity inspires me. I've noticed how you always try to do the right thing, even when it's hard."

**Why it works:** You're telling them what their inner critic never does—that they ARE good, not just correct.

**Avoid saying:**
- "You're always right" (sounds sarcastic)
- "You need to relax" (dismisses their values)
- "It's good enough" (triggers their inner critic)

### Type 2: The Helper

**Core fear:** Being unloved or unwanted for who they are

Type 2s give constantly because they fear that without being useful, they won't be loved. They need to know they matter beyond what they provide.

**Say this:** "I love spending time with you—not because of what you do for me, but because of who you are."

**Why it works:** You're separating their worth from their usefulness. This is the validation they crave but rarely receive.

**Avoid saying:**
- "Thanks for helping" (too transactional)
- "What would I do without you?" (reinforces usefulness = worth)
- "You're so selfless" (pressure to keep giving)

### Type 3: The Achiever

**Core fear:** Being worthless without achievements

Type 3s chase success because they believe they ARE their accomplishments. Deep down, they fear that without the wins, no one would want them.

**Say this:** "I admire who you are, not just what you've achieved. The person behind all that success is someone I genuinely respect."

**Why it works:** You're seeing past the resume to the human. That's rare for them—and deeply meaningful.

**Avoid saying:**
- "You're so successful" (surface level—they hear this constantly)
- "You're a machine!" (dehumanizing)
- "I could never do what you do" (puts them on a pedestal)

**What the kids say:**

- "Your grind don't stop, and it's hella inspiring."
- "Turning dreams to reality? That's your daily flex."
- "Who needs clout when they've got your ambition?"
- "Every time you hit a goal, it's a whole mood."
- "That success glow suits you."
- "You're the CEO of making things happen."
- "Your playlist is probably just wins on repeat."
- "When you walk, it's like a boss level upgrade."
- "Your achievements are the tea everyone's sipping."
- "Your style? Always on point, just like your game plan."
