Handling emotions- what works on terrrorists will also work on your girlfriend

When your girlfriend or wife is acting crazy you need to do something.

you shouldnt yell at them.
you shouldnt be silent
you shouldnt tell them to calm down or relax
you shouldnt tell them they are acting crazy
you shouldnt inform them what their options are

FBI hostage negotiator
name the emotion
throw out a tactical label- if it can work on terrorists, it can work on your girlfriend

Here is how to label the emotion

think of it this way- something happened that made them lose their shit-
your job is to understand what happened
and let them know you are on their side
