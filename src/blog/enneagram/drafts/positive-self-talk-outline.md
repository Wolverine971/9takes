## Opening Hook (Tactical & Direct)

**Lead:** "That voice in your head? It's not random. It's running a script written when you were five years old."

Every Enneagram type has a specific inner critic pattern - a broken record that plays the same toxic message on repeat. But here's what nobody tells you: once you decode your type's specific self-talk pattern, you can hack it.

This isn't wishful thinking or generic affirmations. This is tactical inner dialogue engineering based on how your specific personality type processes reality.

**The Pattern Recognition Insight:**
- Type 1s hear: "You're not good enough"
- Type 2s hear: "You're selfish if you have needs"
- Type 3s hear: "You're worthless if you're not achieving"
- Type 4s hear: "You're fundamentally flawed"
- Type 5s hear: "You're incompetent"
- Type 6s hear: "Something bad is about to happen"
- Type 7s hear: "You're missing out"
- Type 8s hear: "You're weak if you feel"
- Type 9s hear: "You don't matter"
