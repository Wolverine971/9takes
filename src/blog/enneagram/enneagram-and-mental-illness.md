## Quick Answer

**Can your Enneagram type predict mental health risks?** Yes, each Enneagram type shows specific vulnerabilities to certain mental health conditions. Type 1s commonly struggle with OCD and perfectionism, Type 4s have higher rates of depression, Type 6s frequently experience anxiety disorders. These are predispositions, not certainties - your type indicates tendencies and vulnerabilities rather than diagnoses.

We want to think that we are not capable of becoming mentally ill. But the end result of a downward spiral started somewhere.

Here, we will use the Enneagram to look at the negative aspects of different personalities. We will examine how each personality type in an unhealthy state can go down a negative spiral toward mental illness. We draw insights from "<a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Enneagram-Psychological-Spiritual-Personality/dp/0553378201?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=9takes00-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=934a7202b7f300b1da70746ab59814ba&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Wisdom of the Enneagram</a>" by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson, which delves into the dark side of each Enneagram type.

These dark sides are called the **"shadow side,"** and it is central to this exploration. In examining these shadow sides, we better understand how each Enneagram type navigates its mental landscapes and spirals into unhealthy patterns illustrated through specific scenarios.

## Important Context and Disclaimer

The Enneagram is a **personality framework**—not a diagnostic tool. Everyone’s experience with mental health is unique, and symptoms or challenges can vary widely. This article is for **informational and self-reflection purposes** only and **does not replace professional mental health advice**. If you believe you might be experiencing mental health issues, please seek help from a qualified medical or mental health professional.

In addition, we aim to address these topics with **sensitivity and inclusivity**. Mental health struggles affect people of all backgrounds, and it's important to use non-stigmatizing language. By exploring each type's risks, we encourage empathy and understanding—both for ourselves and for those around us.

Type 1s experience obsessive thinking about mistakes, compulsive checking behaviors, and rigid standards. These patterns can develop into OCD in unhealthy Type 1s, but many Type 1s are simply perfectionistic without meeting OCD diagnostic criteria."

It provides a framework for understanding your defense mechanisms, core wounds, and growth paths. Many therapists use the Enneagram as a supplementary tool to customize treatment approaches based on your type's specific needs and patterns."
