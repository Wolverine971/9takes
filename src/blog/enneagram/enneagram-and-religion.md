<p class="firstLetter">"Is the Enneagram a religious thing?"</p>

Well, the answer is complex because the Enneagram is old.

It has been both influenced by and also done the influencing in many spiritual traditions. It has found its way into many religious practices - from Christianity to Judaism, from Sufism to New Age philosophies. Yet, at its core, the Enneagram remains a psychological tool for self-understanding and personal growth.

Here, we'll examine the Enneagram's adoption by different religious groups, exploring how each tradition has interpreted and applied this system. We'll uncover the enthusiasm it has generated, the controversies it has sparked, and the unique insights it offers across various belief systems.

## Christianity and the Enneagram

In Christianity, the Enneagram has been widely adopted as a powerful tool for spiritual growth and self-discovery. Its integration into Christian practice has sparked both enthusiasm and debate within various denominations.

### Richard Rohr's Influence

Richard Rohr, a Franciscan friar, has been instrumental in popularizing the Enneagram within Christian circles. He views it as a means to deepen self-understanding and foster spiritual development. Rohr's Center for Action and Contemplation offers numerous resources on the Enneagram, including:

- Online courses exploring the Enneagram from a Christian perspective
- Books like "The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective"
- Regular workshops and retreats

### Biblical Connections

Some Christian scholars draw parallels between Enneagram types and biblical figures:

- Type 1 (Perfectionist) - Moses
- Type 2 (Helper) - Martha
- Type 3 (Achiever) - Solomon
- Type 4 (Individualist) - King David
- Type 5 (Investigator) - Thomas the Apostle
- Type 6 (Loyalist) - Peter
- Type 7 (Enthusiast) - Jacob
- Type 8 (Challenger) - Paul
- Type 9 (Peacemaker) - Abraham

#### Enneagram Types and the Fruits of the Spirit

In Christian theology, the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) represent virtues that believers should cultivate. Here's how each Enneagram type might particularly benefit from a specific fruit of the Spirit:

- Type 1 (The Perfectionist) - **Patience**: Finding grace in the process of growth and imperfection.
- Type 2 (The Helper) - **Love**: Giving unconditionally without expectation of return.
- Type 3 (The Achiever) - **Faithfulness**: Valuing authenticity over external validation.
- Type 4 (The Individualist) - **Joy**: Finding contentment and beauty in the ordinary.
- Type 5 (The Investigator) - **Kindness**: Connecting more deeply with others to balance detachment.
- Type 6 (The Loyalist) - **Peace**: Finding security in faith rather than external circumstances.
- Type 7 (The Enthusiast) - **Self-control**: Discovering depth and meaning in experiences.
- Type 8 (The Challenger) - **Gentleness**: Balancing strength with vulnerability and softer expressions.
- Type 9 (The Peacemaker) - **Goodness**: Actively engaging in positive change rather than passive acceptance.

By focusing on these fruits of the Spirit, individuals can address their type-specific challenges while growing in their spiritual journey.

### Spiritual Formation

Many Christian leaders use the Enneagram as a tool for spiritual formation:

- Identifying core motivations and fears to address in prayer and meditation
- Recognizing patterns of sin and areas for growth
- Developing compassion for self and others
- Enhancing relationships within church communities

### Contemplative Prayer

The Enneagram is often integrated into contemplative prayer practices:

- Using type-specific mantras or scripture verses
- Tailoring meditation techniques to each type's strengths and challenges
- Incorporating body prayer aligned with each type's energy centers

### Critiques and Controversies

Not all Christian denominations embrace the Enneagram:

- Some argue it lacks biblical foundation
- Concerns about its alleged occult or New Age origins
- Debates over its compatibility with Christian doctrine

### Denominational Adoption

Various Christian denominations have incorporated the Enneagram:

- Catholic retreats and spiritual direction programs
- Protestant leadership development workshops
- Evangelical small group studies and personal growth resources

### Christian Enneagram Resources

Numerous Christian authors have written on the Enneagram:

- "The Road Back to You" by Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile
- "Mirror for the Soul" by Alice Fryling
- "The Sacred Enneagram" by Christopher L. Heuertz

The Enneagram's integration into Christian practice continues to evolve, offering believers a unique lens through which to understand their spiritual journey and relationship with God. While not universally accepted, its impact on Christian spiritual formation is significant and growing.

## Sufism and the Enneagram's Origins

The Enneagram's connection to Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam, is complex. While these links remain largely speculative, they offer intriguing insights into the Enneagram's possible origins and spiritual dimensions.

- **Symbolic Similarities**: The nine-pointed Enneagram symbol bears a striking resemblance to certain Sufi diagrams. For instance, the Sufi Naqshbandi order uses a similar nine-pointed star in their spiritual practices, representing the nine levels of consciousness.
- **Numerical Significance**: In Sufism, numbers hold deep symbolic meaning. The number nine, central to the Enneagram, is particularly significant in Sufi thought, often representing completeness or the qualities of the divine.
- **Spiritual Practices**: Some Enneagram teachings echo Sufi spiritual practices. For example, the Enneagram's emphasis on self-observation and the recognition of one's essential nature aligns with the Sufi concept of 'fana' (annihilation of the ego) and 'baqa' (subsistence in God).
- **Historical Connections: Oscar Ichazo**, one of the key figures in popularizing the Enneagram in the West, claimed to have learned aspects of the system from Sufi teachers. While this claim is debated, it highlights the perceived connection between Sufism and the Enneagram.
- **Shared Goal of Self-Understanding**: Both Sufism and the Enneagram emphasize the importance of self-knowledge as a path to spiritual growth. The Sufi saying "He who knows himself knows his Lord" resonates with the Enneagram's focus on self-discovery.

While these connections are intriguing, it's important to note that they remain speculative. The Enneagram as we know it today is a modern synthesis, influenced by various traditions and contemporary psychology. For those interested in exploring these potential links further, "The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective" by Richard Rohr and Andreas Ebert offers a thoughtful examination of the Enneagram's possible Sufi roots.

## The Enneagram and Judaism

While the Enneagram is not a mainstream practice in Judaism, it has found a niche among some Jewish scholars, rabbis, and practitioners who see value in its potential for self-understanding and spiritual growth. The integration of the Enneagram into Jewish thought and practice offers an interesting perspective on how ancient wisdom traditions can intersect with modern psychological tools.

### Historical Context

The relationship between Judaism and the Enneagram is relatively recent, emerging primarily in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This intersection reflects a broader trend in contemporary Judaism of exploring diverse spiritual practices while maintaining traditional Jewish values and beliefs.

### Kabbalah and the Enneagram

Some Jewish scholars have drawn parallels between the Enneagram and Kabbalistic teachings:

- Rabbi David Cooper, in his book "<a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/God-Verb-Kabbalah-Practice-Mystical/dp/1573226947">God Is a Verb: Kabbalah and the Practice of Mystical Judaism</a>," explores potential connections between the Enneagram and Kabbalistic concepts.
- The nine points of the Enneagram are sometimes compared to the ten sefirot (divine emanations) in Kabbalah, with some seeing parallels in how both systems describe aspects of human nature and the divine.

### Jewish Values and the Enneagram

Some Jewish practitioners find that the Enneagram aligns with core Jewish values:

- Tikkun Olam (repairing the world): The Enneagram's focus on personal growth and understanding others is seen as supporting this Jewish principle.
- Mussar (ethical self-improvement): The Enneagram's emphasis on recognizing and working with one's personality traits resonates with Mussar practices.

### Rabbinical Perspectives

While not universally accepted, some rabbis have incorporated the Enneagram into their work:

- Rabbi Mordecai Gafni has written about the Enneagram in relation to Jewish spirituality, seeing it as a tool for understanding the "unique self."
- Rabbi Jill Zimmerman offers workshops and teachings that integrate the Enneagram with Jewish wisdom and practices.

### Jewish Enneagram Resources

Several resources explore the intersection of Judaism and the Enneagram:

- "The Enneagram and Kabbalah" by Rabbi Howard A. Addison offers a comprehensive look at how these two systems can complement each other.
- "Becoming Soulful: Using the Enneagram for Jewish Spiritual Growth" by Reb Mimi Feigelson provides insights into using the Enneagram within a Jewish context.

### Practical Applications in Jewish Communities

Some Jewish communities and organizations have begun to incorporate the Enneagram:

- Synagogues offering Enneagram workshops as part of adult education programs
- Jewish retreat centers including Enneagram-based sessions in their offerings
- Jewish counselors and therapists using the Enneagram as a tool in their practice

### Controversies and Debates

The adoption of the Enneagram in Jewish contexts is not without controversy:

- Some argue that it's unnecessary, given the rich tradition of Jewish spiritual and psychological teachings.
- Others express concern about integrating non-Jewish spiritual practices into Judaism.
- Debates continue about whether the Enneagram complements or conflicts with traditional Jewish thought.

### Comparative Studies

Some scholars have undertaken comparative studies:

- Exploring parallels between Enneagram types and biblical figures in the Torah
- Examining how Enneagram insights might inform interpretations of Jewish texts and traditions

While the Enneagram remains a niche interest within Judaism, its growing presence reflects a broader trend of Jewish engagement with diverse spiritual and psychological tools. As with any such integration, it continues to evolve, sparking both interest and debate within Jewish communities.

## New Age, Esoteric Groups, and the Enneagram

The Enneagram has found significant popularity within New Age and esoteric circles, where it's often integrated into a broader framework of spiritual and personal development practices. This adoption reflects the Enneagram's versatility and its resonance with many core New Age concepts.

### Historical Context

The Enneagram's integration into New Age thought gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, coinciding with the broader New Age movement. Its blend of psychology, spirituality, and self-help appealed to those seeking alternative paths to self-discovery.

### Theosophy and the Enneagram

Some New Age practitioners draw connections between the Enneagram and Theosophical teachings:

- The nine-pointed symbol is sometimes linked to the "nine emanations" in Theosophical cosmology.
- Helena Blavatsky's writings on human nature and spiritual evolution are often compared to Enneagram concepts.

### Energy Work and the Enneagram

In New Age and energy healing circles, practitioners often draw connections between the Enneagram types and the seven main chakras of the body.

Individual experiences may vary, and it's always recommended to approach such practices with an open yet discerning mind.

### Channeling and the Enneagram

Some New Age teachers claim to have received Enneagram insights through channeling:

### Comparative Studies

    Some New Age scholars have undertaken comparative studies:

The Enneagram's popularity in New Age and esoteric circles has led to a rich tapestry of interpretations and applications. While this diversity has expanded the Enneagram's reach, it has also sparked debates about authenticity and effectiveness. As with many New Age practices, the integration of the Enneagram continues to evolve, reflecting the eclectic and syncretic nature of the New Age movement.

<!-- ### New Age, Esoteric Groups, and the Enneagram

The Enneagram has also found its way into various New Age and esoteric groups.

The Enneagram is often adopted as a personal and spiritual development tool, drawing on different religious and spiritual traditions in their interpretation of the system.

## The Enneagram in Jesuit Tradition

The Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, is a Catholic religious order renowned for its commitment to education, intellectual exploration, and spiritual formation. The Jesuits' engagement with the Enneagram reflects their long-standing tradition of integrating various forms of knowledge in the pursuit of spiritual growth and understanding.
