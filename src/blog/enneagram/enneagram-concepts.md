<p class="firstLetter">The Enneagram is your personality in a box.</p>

Another way to say it is that the Enneagram identifies common patterns among people and has identified 9 distinct personality types. Now it does break down further and every Enneagram enthusiast should tell you that it is a tool isn't meant to describe you in every detail. However if you have never heard of it you might be suprised by the detail to which you can be described in the Enneagram.

## What's This Enneagram Thing Anyway?

The Enneagram isn't just another personality quiz you take when you're bored at work. It's a system that maps out nine distinct personality types, each with its own worldview, motivations, and quirks. Think of it as a GPS for your psyche.

[Curious about where this system came from? Check out the Enneagram's intriguing origins.](https://9takes.com/enneagram-corner/enneagram-influences)

## What the Enneagram Is Not

Before we dive in, let's clear up some misconceptions:

1. It's not a strengths and weaknesses checklist.
2. It doesn't box you into "thinker" or "feeler" categories.
3. It's not an introvert-extrovert sorter.

## What the Enneagram Actually Is

The Enneagram is all about:

1. Your core motivations (what gets you out of bed in the morning)
2. Your deepest fears (what keeps you up at night)
3. Your coping mechanisms (how you deal when things get tough)

## The Nine Types: A Quick Tour

1. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-1" >The Perfectionist</a>: Striving for improvement
2. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-2" >The Helper</a>: Seeking to be needed
3. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-3" >The Achiever</a>: Chasing success
4. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-4" >The Individualist</a>: Searching for identity
5. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-5" >The Investigator</a>: Pursuing knowledge
6. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-6" >The Loyalist</a>: Seeking security
7. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7" >The Enthusiast</a>: Avoiding pain
8. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-8" >The Challenger</a>: Asserting strength
9. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-9" >The Peacemaker</a>: Maintaining harmony

## The Three Centers: Head, Heart, and Gut

The Enneagram groups these types into three centers:

1. Head Center (5, 6, 7): These types lead with their thinking.
2. Heart Center (2, 3, 4): These types lead with their feelings.
3. Gut Center (8, 9, 1): These types lead with their instincts.

## Wings: Because One Type Isn't Complicated Enough

Your wing is like your personality's sidekick - it's the type on either side of your main type that influences your behavior.

## Levels of Development: The Personality Growth Chart

Each type can operate at different levels of health. It's like a video game - you can level up or down depending on your choices.

## Stress and Growth Arrows: Your Personality's Secret Passages

Under stress or during growth, you may take on characteristics of other types. It's like your personality has secret tunnels to other rooms.

[Dive deeper into how types change under stress.](https://9takes.com/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-in-stress)

## Instinctual Subtypes: Your Survival Strategies

Each type has three subtypes based on basic human needs:

1. Self-preservation: Focused on personal security
2. Social: Prioritizing group dynamics
3. Sexual (One-to-one): Emphasizing intense connections

[Learn more about these subtypes and how they shape behavior.](https://9takes.com/enneagram-corner/enneagram-instinctual-subtypes)

## Advanced Concepts: For the Enneagram Nerds

### Triads: Alternative Type Groupings

Triads are ways of categorizing the nine Enneagram types into groups of three, each offering a different perspective on how personalities operate:

#### Hornevian Groups (Karen Horney)

These groups, named after psychoanalyst Karen Horney, describe how types interact with others and the world:

- Assertive types actively shape their environment (3, 7, 8).
- Compliant types adapt to meet perceived expectations (1, 2, 6).
- Withdrawn types maintain distance for self-protection (4, 5, 9).

#### Harmonic Groups

These groups reflect how types cope with difficulty:

- Competency types focus on logic and efficiency (1, 3, 5).
- Reactive types express emotions readily and seek understanding (4, 6, 8).
- Positive Outlook types maintain optimism and seek silver linings (2, 7, 9).

#### Object Relations

These groups, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, describe core relational issues:

- Attachment types seek connection and validation from others (3, 6, 9).
- Frustration types feel a sense of inner lack or missing piece (1, 4, 7).
- Rejection types struggle with closeness, either pushing away or withdrawing (2, 5, 8).

### Holy Ideas and Virtues: The high points of each type

8. Innocence: Purity of intention and openness to experience.
9. Action: Engaged and purposeful behavior.

### Fixations and Passions: The low points of each type

#### Fixations

1. Resentment: Persistent anger or bitterness.
2. Flattery: Excessive or insincere praise.
