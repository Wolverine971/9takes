<p class="firstLetter">The Enneagram is not a "static" personality model.</p>

It is a dynamic system built on our emotional state under different circumstances. One of the most fascinating aspects of the Enneagram is the concept of connecting lines, which represent the paths of integration (growth) and disintegration (stress). In this blog post, we'll provide examples of how each type might look in growth and in stress.

## The Dynamics of the Enneagram

Each Enneagram type is connected to two other types via connecting lines.

One line leads to the type that represents our path of integration or growth, where we take on some of the positive traits of another type. We are on the path of integration when we are feeling secure or operating out of our higher selves.

The other line leads to the type that represents our path of disintegration or stress. This is where we take on some of the negative traits of another type. We are on the path of disintegration when we are under stress or operating out of our lower selves.

Here is how these lines show up for each Enneagram type:

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 1 - The Reformer</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Seven)**: When healthily challenged, Ones lighten up, embracing more spontaneity and positivity. They abandon their rigidity, giving room for a fun, carefree approach to life, much like the joyful Sevens.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Four)**: However, when stress mounts, Ones can mirror Fours' melancholy, becoming emotionally turbulent and overly self-critical, almost as if their inner critic is on steroids.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 2 - The Helper</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Four)**: When Helpers integrate, they embrace the introspective nature of Fours. They become more self-nurturing, developing a rich inner life, independent of their relationships.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Eight**): Under pressure, Twos might exhibit the controlling nature of Eights. They become demanding and possessive, insisting that they know what's best for others.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 3 - The Achiever</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Six)**: As Threes integrate, they adopt the loyal and responsible traits of Sixes. They become more team-oriented and less focused on personal achievement.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Nine)**: Stressed Threes, however, can mirror Nines' complacency. They become disengaged, tuning out reality to avoid their fears of failure.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 4 - The Individualist</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type 1)**: When Fours are growing, they become more disciplined and objective, like healthy Ones. They learn to take practical steps towards achieving their ideals and are less swayed by their fluctuating emotions.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Two)**: But under stress, Fours can turn into over-involved and intrusive helpers like Twos, seeking validation and identity in relationships.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 5 - The Investigator</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Eight)**: Fives, when integrated, exhibit the assertive traits of Eights. They become more engaged with the outside world, showing confidence in their knowledge and skills.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Seven)**: However, during disintegration, Fives can become scattered and frenetic like Sevens, escaping into mental fantasies to avoid their fear of being useless.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 6 - The Loyalist</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Nine)**: Healthy Sixes become serene and accepting like Nines. They trust their decisions and experience a refreshing sense of calm and stability.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Three)**: Under stress, Sixes can adopt the deceptive traits of Threes, becoming competitive and image-conscious, masking their insecurities with a facade of confidence.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 7 - The Enthusiast</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Five)**: Sevens, when they integrate, mirror the insightful depth of Fives. They become more focused, diving deeper into experiences instead of flitting from one thing to the next.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type One)**: But when under stress, Sevens can become critical and impatient like Ones, trying to control their environment to escape their fear of pain.

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 8 - The Challenger</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Two)**: Healthy Eights adopt the nurturing traits of Twos. They use their strength to protect and support others, displaying a softer, more caring side.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Five)**: When stressed, Eights may retreat into the detached world of Fives, becoming secretive and withholding to shield their vulnerability.

<section class="section-content">

<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0">Type 9 - The Peacemaker</h3>

Growth/ Integration **(Moving to Type Three)**: When integrating, Nines exhibit the efficiency and motivation of Threes. They become more engaged and energetic, driven to achieve personal goals.

Stress/ Disintegration **(Moving to Type Six)**: Under stress, Nines can resemble anxious Sixes, becoming worry-prone and doubting their decisions, trying to maintain their peace at all costs.
