<summary class="accordion">What is Enneagram?</summary>
<div class="panel">
 <p>The term "Enneagram" comes from the Greek words "ennea" and "gramma".</p>
  <p>"Ennea" is the Greek word for nine, and "gramma" means something written or drawn. So, combined, "Enneagram" essentially translates to "nine-pointed diagram."</p>
  <p>The Enneagram symbol itself is a circle with nine points on its circumference, each point representing one of the nine fundamental personality types. These points are connected by lines to form a geometric figure that illustrates the connections and interactions among the types.</p>
  <p>Though the exact origins of the Enneagram system are a subject of debate, it is generally believed to have ancient roots, with influences from mystical aspects of Christianity, Sufism, and other spiritual traditions. The modern usage of the Enneagram as a personality typology is largely credited to the Bolivian psychologist and philosopher Oscar Ichazo in the mid-20th century, and later developed by psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo.</p>

<summary class="accordion">How do I identify my Enneagram type?</summary>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There are various online tests and assessments that can help individuals identify their Enneagram type, but these
    should be used as a starting point for self-reflection and exploration, rather than as a definitive answer.</p>
  <p>The Enneagram system is complex and nuanced, and it can take time and self-awareness to accurately identify one's type.
    Some individuals may find it helpful to read about each type and reflect on which one resonates most with their
    personality traits, tendencies, and motivations.</p>

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">Can your Enneagram type change over time?</summary>
  <p class="panel">While individuals may exhibit traits or tendencies from other Enneagram types throughout their lives, the core
    motivations, fears, and desires that define each type typically remain relatively stable over time. <br> <br>However, the
    Enneagram system emphasizes personal growth and self-awareness, and individuals can work to become more balanced and
    integrated within their type, as well as to develop traits and qualities associated with other types.
 </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">How does Enneagram differ from other personality tests like Myers-Briggs or the Big
  Five?</summary>
  <p class="panel">The Enneagram differs from other personality tests in its focus on core motivations and fears, as well as its
    emphasis on personal growth and self-awareness. <br> <br> While other tests may categorize individuals based on traits or
    tendencies, the Enneagram seeks to uncover the underlying motivations and desires that drive behavior. Additionally,
    the Enneagram can be used as a tool for personal growth and self-awareness, while other tests may primarily be used
    for career or job placement.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">Is Enneagram scientific?</summary>
 <p class="panel">The Enneagram system is not based on scientific research or empirical data, but rather on anecdotal evidence
  and personal observation.<br> <br> The official origins are somewhat convoluted but can be traced back to a Chilean psychiatrist Claudio
  Naranjo and further back to a Bolivian spiritual teacher named Oscar Ichazo. However, the general principles of the Enneagram are
  eerily similar to Sigmund Freud's works on the id, ego and superego. Furthermore this three part distinction of the human psyche
  goes even further back and parallels Plato's description of the human soul (<a href="/enneagram-corner/philosophy-psychology-and-the-enneagram" >see here</a>).
    </p>

</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">Can Enneagram be used in therapy?</summary>
  <p class="panel">Yes, the Enneagram can be used in therapy as a tool for increasing self-awareness, understanding core motivations
    and fears, and improving communication and relationship dynamics. Therapists may use the Enneagram in conjunction
    with other therapeutic modalities to help clients achieve personal growth and healing.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">Can Enneagram be used in the workplace?</summary>
  <p class="panel">Yes, the Enneagram can be used in the workplace to <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-team-dynamics" >improve team dynamics</a>, communication, and conflict resolution.
    Employers may use the Enneagram as a <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-workplace-team-building">tool for leadership development</a>, <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-team-diversity">talent management</a>, and <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-working-in-teams">working-in-teams</a>.
    Additionally, understanding individual Enneagram types can help employees better understand their own</p>

  self-awareness, understanding motivations, and identifying areas for development.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="accordion">How does the Enneagram relate to psychology?</summary>

  researched as other personality theories. However, some studies and anecdotal evidence support its usefulness in understanding personality
  patterns.</p>
