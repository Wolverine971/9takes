<p class="firstLetter">Nobody owns the Enneagram. It has no single creator. And that's the point.</p>

The system emerged from the collision of Sufi mysticism, Greek philosophy, Armenian spiritual teachers, Chilean psychiatrists, and American psychologists — each adding layers to something none of them invented alone.

**The Enneagram isn't a brand. It's an archeological discovery — unearthed piece by piece across centuries and continents.**

Here's who found what.

## The Lineage

Different traditions contributed different pieces. Each school has its own interpretation — and each added something essential.

### Sufi Tradition - ~10th-14th Centuries AD

The Sufi tradition is an Islamic mystical tradition that is one of the earliest recorded sources of the Enneagram. Sufi teachings emphasize the importance of self-knowledge and spiritual awakening, and many Sufi masters have used the Enneagram as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth. The Enneagram's nine-pointed symbol is believed to represent the nine qualities of God, and each Enneagram type is seen as a reflection of a specific aspect of the divine. The Sufi tradition's emphasis on the spiritual significance of the Enneagram has helped to bring a greater depth and richness to the Enneagram as a tool for personal growth and spiritual development. Today, many Enneagram practitioners continue to draw inspiration from the Sufi tradition and its teachings on the Enneagram. <a href="https://sufipathoflove.com/enneagram-in-sufism/" title="">Learn more about it here</a>

### Gurdjieff Work - Early 20th Century, 1915-1949

George Gurdjieff was a Greek-Armenian spiritual teacher and philosopher who is widely credited with <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cac.org/daily-meditations/gurdjieff-and-the-enneagram-2020-03-02/" title="Gurdjieff and the Enneagram">introducing the Enneagram symbol to the Western world</a>. Gurdjieff's teachings on the Enneagram were based on the idea that human beings are not fully conscious, and that through self-awareness and self-observation, individuals can attain a higher level of consciousness and spiritual awakening. Gurdjieff's influence on the Enneagram was significant, as he was one of the first to use the symbol as a tool for spiritual growth and self-discovery. Many contemporary Enneagram teachings and systems are based on Gurdjieff's original ideas.

### Oscar Ichazo - Mid 20th Century, 1950s-1960s

Oscar Ichazo a Bolivian-born mystic and philosopher is another key figure in the development of the Enneagram. Ichazo developed his Enneagram teachings through a combination of his studies in various spiritual traditions and his own inner experiences. His approach to the Enneagram focused on the idea that individuals are born with a specific temperament or personality type, which is influenced by their spiritual essence. He went on to create the <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.arica.org/" title="">Arica Institute</a>

### Claudio Naranjo - Late 20th Century, 1970s

Claudio Naranjo studied with Ichazo in Chile. <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Ichazo#Protoanalysis" title="Explaining Oscar Ichazo Protoanalysis">"His contribution to the Enneagram successfully joined the insight and methods of a mystical path of transformation with the intellectual power of a Western psychological model".</a> Naranjo's work helped to popularize the Enneagram in the Western world and his teachings continue to be a source of inspiration for many Enneagram enthusiasts today. His legacy includes the creation of the Enneagram of Personality, which is one of the most widely used Enneagram systems today.

## Outside Influences

### Ancient Philosophy - Classical Antiquity, ~428 – 347 BC

The idea of dividing the human psyche into categories or "types" can be traced back to Plato's "Republic", where he discusses the concept of tripartite souls divided into rational, spirited, and appetitive categories. The Enneagram's three centers of intelligence, which divide individuals into thinking, feeling, and instinctual types, can be seen as a modern-day interpretation of Plato's ideas. <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/themes/" title="SparkNotes on the Republic">SparkNotes</a> provides a comprehensive analysis of Plato's "Republic" where plato talks about the tripartite souls.

### Early Psychology - Late 19th to Early 20th Century, 1890s-1920s

The concept of personality types also has roots in early psychology, such as <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html" title="Explaining Freud's theory from simplypsychology.org">Freud's theories of the id, ego, and superego</a>. Freud’s id represents the primitive and instinctual desires of an individual, which can be likened to the Enneagram’s concept of instincts. The ego, on the other hand, is the rational and decision-making aspect of the psyche, which corresponds to the Enneagram’s idea of the head. Finally, the superego represents the moral and ethical aspect of the psyche, which aligns with the Enneagram’s concept of the heart. Additionally, the Enneagram's centers of intelligence can be linked to Carl Jung's ideas of thinking, feeling, and sensing types.

Why did early psychology develop these ideas further? 🤷

## Modern Interpretations of the Enneagram

Today, the Enneagram is widely used as a personality typing system that helps individuals understand themselves and others better. There are several modern interpretations of the Enneagram, each with its own set of personality types and descriptions. While there is no one "right" way to approach the Enneagram, different schools of thought have emerged over time, each with its own unique perspective on the Enneagram and how it can be used.

### The Narrative Tradition - Late 20th Century to Present, 1990s-Present

One of the most popular schools of thought when it comes to the Enneagram is the narrative tradition. This approach focuses on storytelling and personal anecdotes, allowing individuals to explore their Enneagram type in a more personal and relatable way. The narrative tradition is often used in Enneagram workshops and retreats, where individuals can learn about their type in a supportive and interactive environment.

### The Integrative Tradition - Early 21st Century to Present, 2000s-Present

Another school of thought when it comes to the Enneagram is the integrative tradition. This approach combines elements from various Enneagram schools of thought, allowing individuals to explore the Enneagram in a holistic and comprehensive way. The integrative tradition emphasizes the importance of personal growth and development, using the Enneagram as a tool for self-discovery and transformation.

## The Unfinished Story

The Enneagram has been refined by mystics, philosophers, psychiatrists, and psychologists — each adding precision to something none of them fully understood.

**And it's not done evolving.**

Modern interpretations continue to emerge. Researchers test its claims. Therapists adapt its insights. Each generation adds its layer to the discovery.

The question isn't whether the Enneagram is "true" — it's whether these patterns match what you actually observe in yourself and others.

**The only way to know is to test it yourself.**
