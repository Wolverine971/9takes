<p class="firstLetter">Enneagram subtypes, also known as instinctual variants, add depth to the nine core Enneagram types. These subtypes reflect our basic human needs and drive our behaviors in specific areas of life.</p>

## The Three Subtypes

1. Self-Preservation (SP): This subtype focuses on physical safety, comfort, and well-being. People with a dominant self-preservation instinct are often concerned with health, financial security, and creating a stable environment.

2. Social (SO): The social subtype is attuned to group dynamics, community, and belonging. Those with a dominant social instinct are often concerned with their role in groups, social status, and contributing to their community.

3. One-to-One (SX): Also known as the sexual subtype, this variant focuses on intense personal connections and experiences. People with a dominant one-to-one instinct often seek deep, passionate relationships and are drawn to intense experiences in various areas of life.

Each Enneagram type expresses these subtypes differently, creating nuanced variations within each type. Let's explore how these subtypes manifest in each of the nine Enneagram types.

## Subtype Stacking

Subtype stacking refers to the order of preference for the three instinctual drives in an individual. Everyone has all three instincts, but they're usually prioritized in a specific order.

### The Concept of Stacking

1. Dominant instinct: The primary focus and strongest drive
2. Secondary instinct: Supports the dominant instinct, used situationally
3. Blind spot: The least developed instinct, often neglected

For example, a stacking might be sp/so/sx (self-preservation first, social second, one-to-one third).

### How Stacking Affects Personality and Behavior

- The dominant instinct colors most of a person's behavior and concerns
- The secondary instinct supports the dominant one and comes into play in specific situations
- The blind spot instinct is often underdeveloped and may cause difficulties in related areas of life

Example: An Eight with a sp/sx/so stacking will focus primarily on resource accumulation and control (sp), seek intense personal relationships (sx), but may struggle with broader social dynamics and group politics (so).

Understanding subtype stacking provides a more nuanced view of personality, explaining why two people of the same Enneagram type and dominant instinct might still behave quite differently.
