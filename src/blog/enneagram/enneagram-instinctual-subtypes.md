<p class="firstLetter">
The Enneagram goes beyond its nine core types by introducing three instinctual subtypes—Self-Preservation, Social, and One-to-One. Each subtype reflects how we meet our fundamental needs and shapes our priorities in relationships, work, and personal well-being. By understanding your dominant (and secondary) instinct, you can gain deeper insight into how you navigate daily life, relationships, and challenges.
</p>

## Why Instinctual Subtypes Matter

Each of us has all three instincts, but we **prioritize** them differently. Your **dominant** instinct often drives your core behaviors and motivations. Your **secondary** instinct surfaces as needed, while your **blind spot** might be an area of underdevelopment or neglect.

- **Self-Preservation (SP)**: Focuses on physical safety, comfort, and personal well-being.
- **Social (SO)**: Emphasizes community, group dynamics, and belonging.
- **One-to-One (SX)**: Also called “sexual” instinct; seeks intense, close bonds or experiences.

### A Note on Limitations and Disclaimers

- The Enneagram, including its instinctual subtypes, is a **personal growth framework**, not a scientifically validated diagnostic tool.
- These insights are intended for **self-reflection** and **improvement**, not to label or confine you.
- If you have serious psychological or emotional concerns, please consult a qualified mental health professional.

## Subtype Stacking

Beyond these dominant instincts, each person has a **stacking** that orders the three instincts by priority:

1. **Dominant Instinct** – your strongest, most noticeable driver
2. **Secondary Instinct** – influential but less central
3. **Blind Spot** – the least developed instinct, often neglected

**Example**: An `sp/sx/so` person focuses on self-preservation, then one-to-one, with the social instinct as a blind spot.

### Why Stacking Matters

- Explains differences among people who share the same type and dominant instinct
- Clarifies why two Self-Preservation Eights can still appear quite different
- Identifies growth areas in your “blind spot,” guiding deeper self-awareness
