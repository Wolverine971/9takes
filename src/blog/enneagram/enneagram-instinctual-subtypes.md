## What are Enneagram subtypes?

Enneagram subtypes refer to the three different variations of each of the nine Enneagram types. These subtypes are commonly known as instinctual variants and include self-preservation, social, and one-to-one. The Enneagram subtypes are based on our most basic human needs, such as survival, socialization, and intimacy.

## Self-Preservation Enneagram Subtypes:

Self-preservation Enneagram subtypes are characterized by an intense focus on physical survival and well-being. These individuals are typically concerned with their own needs and can sometimes appear selfish or self-absorbed. There are three self-preservation Enneagram subtypes:

1. Self-Preservation Ones: Self-preservation Ones are focused on maintaining their physical well-being through routines and healthy habits.
2. Self-Preservation Twos: Self-preservation Twos are focused on meeting their own basic needs, such as food, shelter, and safety.
3. Self-Preservation Threes: Self-preservation Threes are focused on their own success and achievements, often prioritizing their career and financial stability.

## Social Enneagram Subtypes:

Social Enneagram subtypes are characterized by a strong need for social connection and belonging. These individuals are often highly involved in their communities and are deeply concerned with social issues. There are three social Enneagram subtypes:

1. Social Ones: Social Ones are focused on making positive changes in society and working towards a better future for all.
2. Social Twos: Social Twos are focused on building strong relationships and helping others in their community.
3. Social Threes: Social Threes are focused on their image and reputation, often seeking approval and recognition from their social networks.

## One-to-One/ Sexual Enneagram Subtypes:

One-to-One Enneagram subtypes are characterized by a strong need for intimacy and connection with others. These individuals often prioritize their relationships above all else and are highly attuned to their own emotions and those of others. There are three one-to-one Enneagram subtypes:

1. One-to-One Ones: One-to-One Ones are focused on building deep, meaningful connections with others and often prioritize their romantic relationships.
2. One-to-One Twos: One-to-One Twos are highly empathetic and nurturing, often prioritizing the needs of their loved ones over their own.
3. One-to-One Threes: One-to-One Threes are focused on building a strong personal brand and often prioritize their romantic relationships as a means of enhancing their image.

## Conclusion:

Enneagram subtypes are an essential component of the Enneagram system, providing a deeper understanding of personality types and behavior. By recognizing our own Enneagram subtype and that of others, we can better understand our motivations and behaviors, leading to improved relationships and personal growth.
