<p class="firstLetter">Enneagram subtypes refer to the three different variations of each of the nine Enneagram types. These subtypes are commonly known as instinctual variants and include self-preservation, social, and one-to-one. The Enneagram subtypes are based on our most basic human needs, such as survival, socialization, and intimacy.</p>
