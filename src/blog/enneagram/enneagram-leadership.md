<!-- Midjourney Prompt: diverse group of 9 business leaders in a modern glass boardroom, each displaying distinct leadership styles - one pointing assertively at charts, another listening intently, one mediating between others, one analyzing data on tablet, one inspiring the group with animated gestures, one organizing documents methodically, one celebrating team wins, one questioning thoughtfully, one bringing harmony to discussion, professional attire, natural lighting through floor-to-ceiling windows, city skyline background, photorealistic, corporate photography style --ar 16:9 --stylize 750 -->

<QuickAnswer question="What is my Enneagram leadership style?">
Each type has a natural leadership approach: Type 1s set standards. Type 2s develop people. Type 3s drive results. Type 4s bring creative vision. Type 5s provide strategic expertise. Type 6s manage risk. Type 7s spark innovation. Type 8s make bold decisions. Type 9s build consensus. The catch: your greatest strength becomes your blind spot when overused. A Type 8's decisiveness tips into bulldozing. A Type 9's harmony-seeking becomes avoidance. Knowing your pattern is the first step to leading with it instead of being run by it.

<!-- ## The $8.9 Trillion Leadership Crisis Nobody's Talking About  -->
<!-- {#hidden-psychology} -->

<p class="firstLetter">Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report puts a number on bad leadership: $8.9 trillion in lost productivity annually. That's 9% of global GDP.</p>

The same report shows only 21% of employees are engaged at work. The rest? Sleepwalking or actively checked out. And the data points to one factor above all others: the quality of their direct manager.

You've done the leadership training. Read the books. Maybe hired a coach. Yet something still isn't clicking. Your team responds to other leaders differently than they respond to you.

After interviewing 500+ world-class performers, Tim Ferriss noticed a pattern: top leaders don't follow the same playbook. They've each found their own way.

The Enneagram maps nine distinct leadership operating systems. What makes one type inspiring makes another seem fake. What motivates one type's team demoralizes another's. (New to the Enneagram? Start with our [quick overview](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-tldr).)

You've likely been trying to lead like someone you admire rather than like yourself. Your greatest strength, overplayed, becomes your biggest liability.

## Why Your Leadership Approach Backfires

<!-- {#why-not-working} -->

### The Uncomfortable Conversation Problem

Tim Ferriss observed something consistent across world-class leaders: _"A person's success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have."_

Most leaders avoid these conversations. Different types avoid different ones.

Every leadership strength becomes a liability when overused:

- **Decisiveness** tips into steamrolling
- **Empathy** slides into people-pleasing
- **Vision** detaches from execution
- **Analysis** stalls action
- **Harmony** enables dysfunction

The Enneagram shows which conversations you're ducking and why.

### The Three Leadership Centers

Leaders operate from three different centers. Each has a default mode and a blind spot.

**Body/Gut Center (Types 8, 9, 1)**

- Lead through action and instinct
- Default to control and autonomy
- **Blind Spot:** Anger-driven decisions that drive people away

**Heart/Feeling Center (Types 2, 3, 4)**

- Lead through connection and influence
- Default to managing image and relationships
- **Blind Spot:** Performing a role instead of being real

**Head/Thinking Center (Types 5, 6, 7)**

- Lead through strategy and planning
- Default to security and competence
- **Blind Spot:** Overthinking while opportunities pass

Understanding your center reveals your autopilot mode. (For more on [how each type behaves under stress](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-types-in-stress), see our breakdown.)

## The 9 Leadership Archetypes

<!-- {#nine-archetypes} -->

### Type 1: The Standard Bearer

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by example and uphold standards"

**Natural Style:**

- Sets clear expectations and high standards
- Models integrity and work ethic
- Creates systematic processes
- Ensures quality and consistency
- Takes responsibility seriously

**What Teams Love:**

- Always know where they stand
- Clear guidelines and expectations
- Fair and consistent treatment
- Learning from a master of their craft
- Ethical leadership they can trust

**What Teams Fear:**

- Nothing is ever good enough
- Constant criticism and correction
- Rigidity that stifles creativity
- Perfectionism that slows progress
- Being judged for mistakes

**Superpower:** Transforming chaos into order through systems and standards.

**Kryptonite:** Perfectionism that demoralizes teams and prevents delegation.

**Reality Check:** If you've rewritten an email more than twice this week, you're spending time on polish that nobody notices. Teams under perfectionistic leaders report more burnout and less willingness to take creative risks.

**The Fix:** The "70% Rule." If someone can do it 70% as well as you, delegate it. Your time is better spent on what only you can do.

### Type 2: The Servant Leader

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by empowering and supporting others"

**Natural Style:**

- Develops people's potential
- Creates warm, supportive culture
- Anticipates team needs
- Builds strong relationships
- Celebrates others' successes

**What Teams Love:**

- Feeling personally valued
- Support during challenges
- Recognition and appreciation
- Open-door accessibility
- Investment in their growth

**What Teams Fear:**

- Emotional manipulation
- Favoritism and inconsistency
- Guilt trips about loyalty
- Invasive personal interest
- Hidden agendas in kindness

**Superpower:** Creating loyalty through genuine care and development.

**Kryptonite:** Burnout from overgiving and a covert need for appreciation.

**Reality Check:** If you answered work emails during your last vacation, you're creating learned helplessness. Overly supportive leaders produce teams that can't function independently.

**The Fix:** The "Help Budget." You get three assists per day. After that, ask questions instead of giving answers. "What do you think you should do?" builds capability faster than solving their problems.

### Type 3: The Achievement Catalyst

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by driving results and modeling success"

**Natural Style:**

- Sets ambitious goals
- Creates competitive momentum
- Optimizes for efficiency
- Celebrates wins publicly
- Adapts quickly to change

**What Teams Love:**

- Clear path to success
- Recognition for achievements
- Fast-paced advancement
- Learning from a winner
- Results-oriented clarity

**What Teams Fear:**

- Being expendable resources
- Work-life balance destruction
- Credit-stealing behavior
- Image over substance
- Ruthless competition culture

**Superpower:** Transforming average teams into high performers.

**Kryptonite:** Sacrificing people and principles for results.

**Reality Check:** Can you name your top performer's kid? If not, there's a gap between you and your team that they feel even if you don't. High performers leave managers who treat them like productivity units.

**The Fix:** The "Friday Human Check." No metrics talk on Fridays. Just connection. Ask about weekends, hobbies, life outside work. It feels inefficient but builds the trust that makes everything else work.

### Type 4: The Visionary Authentic

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by bringing unique vision and depth"

**Natural Style:**

- Champions authenticity and creativity
- Brings emotional intelligence
- Sees unique potential in people
- Creates meaningful work culture
- Values depth over surface

**What Teams Love:**

- Permission to be authentic
- Creative freedom and expression
- Deep, meaningful work
- Unique team identity
- Emotional validation

**What Teams Fear:**

- Emotional volatility
- Moodiness affecting decisions
- Drama and intensity
- Feeling inadequate or ordinary
- Inconsistent availability

**Superpower:** Creating deeply meaningful and creative work environments.

**Kryptonite:** Emotional turbulence that destabilizes team dynamics.

**Reality Check:** Has your mood determined a meeting's outcome this week? Steve Jobs built Apple into a trillion-dollar company, but his emotional volatility drove away talent who could have contributed even more. Your team reads your energy before they hear your words.

**The Fix:** The "Emotional Weather Report." Start meetings by naming your state. "I'm at 60% today. It's not about you." This simple disclosure stops your team from wondering what they did wrong.

### Type 5: The Strategic Architect

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead through expertise and strategic thinking"

**Natural Style:**

- Develops innovative strategies
- Makes data-driven decisions
- Provides technical expertise
- Respects autonomy and competence
- Minimizes unnecessary interaction

**What Teams Love:**

- Intellectual stimulation
- Autonomous working style
- Competence-based respect
- Strategic clarity
- No micromanagement

**What Teams Fear:**

- Emotional disconnection
- Isolation and minimal feedback
- Over-complexity
- Hoarding of information
- Lack of team cohesion

**Superpower:** Solving complex problems through innovative thinking.

**Kryptonite:** Detachment that leaves teams feeling unsupported.

**Reality Check:** When did you last have lunch with your team? Bill Gates evolved his leadership style over decades. Microsoft's culture shifted when he learned to pair technical brilliance with connection. Knowledge without presence creates a vacuum your team fills with assumptions.

**The Fix:** The "Office Hours Rule." Two hours weekly with an open door, no agenda required. Just availability. Your team needs access to you, not just your decisions.

### Type 6: The Protective Strategist

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by ensuring security and preparedness"

**Natural Style:**

- Anticipates problems and risks
- Builds loyal, cohesive teams
- Creates backup plans
- Questions and verifies thoroughly
- Protects team from threats

**What Teams Love:**

- Feeling protected and secure
- Thorough preparation
- Loyalty and reliability
- Collaborative decision-making
- Risk awareness

**What Teams Fear:**

- Anxiety contagion
- Analysis paralysis
- Constant worst-case scenarios
- Trust issues and suspicion
- Indecisiveness under pressure

**Superpower:** Building bulletproof strategies and loyal teams.

**Kryptonite:** Anxiety that creates the very instability you fear.

**Reality Check:** How many "what if" scenarios did you run through today? Andy Grove's "Only the paranoid survive" built Intel, but paranoia is contagious. Your team picks up your anxiety even when you don't voice it. Worst-case thinking, unchecked, becomes self-fulfilling.

**The Fix:** The "Best Case Plan." For every disaster scenario you map, force yourself to map one where everything goes right. This isn't naive optimism. It's balance. Your natural caution is an asset when paired with possibility.

### Type 7: The Inspirational Innovator

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by inspiring possibility and innovation"

**Natural Style:**

- Generates enthusiasm and energy
- Promotes innovation and experimentation
- Creates positive, fun culture
- Connects diverse ideas and people
- Maintains optimism through challenges

**What Teams Love:**

- Exciting vision and possibilities
- Fun, energetic environment
- Freedom to experiment
- Positive reframing of challenges
- Network connections

**What Teams Fear:**

- Lack of follow-through
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Too many priorities
- Glossing over problems
- Commitment issues

**Superpower:** Transforming challenges into opportunities through optimism.

**Kryptonite:** Avoiding necessary negativity and difficult decisions.

**Reality Check:** How many initiatives did you start but not finish this quarter? Richard Branson has launched hundreds of Virgin ventures. Most people only remember the successes. Your team remembers the abandoned projects and the context-switching that exhausted them.

**The Fix:** The "One Thing Rule." No new project until the current one hits a milestone. Not finished, just a clear milestone. This constraint channels your creative energy instead of scattering it.

### Type 8: The Commanding Force

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by taking charge and protecting my people"

**Natural Style:**

- Makes bold, quick decisions
- Protects team fiercely
- Challenges people to grow
- Takes on the biggest obstacles
- Creates powerful momentum

**What Teams Love:**

- Decisive, strong leadership
- Protection from politics
- Direct, honest communication
- Empowerment to act
- Clear power dynamics

**What Teams Fear:**

- Aggressive confrontation
- Bulldozing opposition
- Vengeance and retaliation
- Emotional insensitivity
- Power struggles

**Superpower:** Breaking through obstacles with sheer force of will.

**Kryptonite:** Intimidation that creates compliance instead of commitment.

**Reality Check:** Do people agree with you quickly? Quick agreement usually means fear, not conviction. Jack Welch transformed GE but left behind burned-out executives and a culture that took decades to repair. Winning the argument doesn't mean winning the outcome.

**The Fix:** The "Power With" Practice. Ask "What do you think?" before stating your opinion. Then wait. A full ten seconds of silence. Real answers take time when people are used to being overridden.

### Type 9: The Consensus Builder

**Leadership Identity:** "I lead by creating harmony and inclusive decisions"

**Natural Style:**

- Builds consensus and buy-in
- Creates inclusive environment
- Mediates conflicts diplomatically
- Sees all perspectives
- Maintains steady calm

**What Teams Love:**

- Inclusive decision-making
- Peaceful work environment
- Being heard and valued
- Steady, calming presence
- Fair mediation

**What Teams Fear:**

- Conflict avoidance
- Delayed difficult decisions
- Passive-aggressive responses
- Lack of clear direction
- Being too accommodating

**Superpower:** Creating harmony and buy-in across diverse groups.

**Kryptonite:** Avoiding necessary conflicts that fester into bigger problems.

**Reality Check:** Are you sitting on a decision right now? One you've been sitting on for days or weeks? Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft with a consensus-building approach, but he also learned when to stop gathering input and decide. Harmony without direction is just comfortable stagnation.

**The Fix:** The "Decision Timer." Forty-eight hours max on any decision. A reversible wrong decision beats no decision. Your team would rather course-correct than wait indefinitely.

## Fatal Leadership Flaws

<!-- {#fatal-flaws} -->

### Type 1: The Criticism Cascade

**The Pattern:** Your high standards create a culture of fear where people hide mistakes, leading to bigger problems.
**The Fix:** Implement "learning from failure" sessions where mistakes are celebrated as growth.

**The Fix:** Implement regular "human check-ins" separate from performance discussions.

### Type 4: The Emotional Rollercoaster

**The Pattern:** Your moods dictate team atmosphere, creating instability and walking-on-eggshells culture.
**The Fix:** Develop emotional regulation practices and communicate your internal state clearly.

### Type 5: The Ivory Tower

**The Pattern:** You withdraw into strategy while your team flounders without guidance.
**The Fix:** Schedule regular "office hours" for team interaction and support.

### Type 6: The Anxiety Amplifier

**The Pattern:** Your worst-case thinking creates the very instability you're trying to prevent.
**The Fix:** Practice "best-case scenario" planning to balance your natural pessimism.

### Type 7: The Shiny Object Syndrome

**The Pattern:** You chase new opportunities before completing current initiatives, exhausting your team.
**The Fix:** Implement a "one thing complete before next thing starts" rule.

### Type 8: The Scorched Earth Policy

**The Pattern:** You win battles but lose wars by destroying relationships in pursuit of goals.
**The Fix:** Practice "power with" instead of "power over" leadership approaches.

### Type 9: The Slow Bleed

**The Pattern:** You avoid addressing problems until they become crises requiring dramatic action.
**The Fix:** Schedule weekly "difficult conversation" time to address issues early.

## A Quick Leadership Diagnostic

<!-- {#diagnostic} -->

Rate yourself honestly on a 1-5 scale.

**Body Center Questions (Types 8, 9, 1):**

1. I make decisions quickly without overthinking \_\_\_
2. People follow my lead without me asking \_\_\_
3. I handle confrontation directly and calmly \_\_\_
4. My anger is controlled and strategic \_\_\_
5. I delegate effectively without micromanaging \_\_\_

**Heart Center Questions (Types 2, 3, 4):**

1. My team knows my authentic self, not just my role \_\_\_
2. I celebrate others' wins as much as my own \_\_\_
3. I can receive criticism without taking it personally \_\_\_
4. My emotions enhance rather than hijack decisions \_\_\_
5. I value being over doing \_\_\_

**Head Center Questions (Types 5, 6, 7):**

1. I act before having all the information \_\_\_
2. I stay focused on one priority at a time \_\_\_
3. I trust my gut over analysis \_\_\_
4. I embrace uncertainty without anxiety \_\_\_
5. I complete projects before starting new ones \_\_\_

### What Your Score Reveals

**Score 20-25:** You've developed balance across centers. Keep refining.

**Score 15-19:** You have clear strengths but one center is underdeveloped. That's your growth edge.

**Score 10-14:** Your dominant center is overcompensating. The questions you scored lowest on point to your blind spot.

**Score Below 10:** You have significant room to grow. Focus on the center where you scored lowest.

Derek Sivers put it well: _"If more information was the answer, then we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs."_

You don't need more leadership training. You need to stop doing what isn't working.

## The Elimination Approach

<!-- {#elimination-method} -->

Tim Ferriss noticed that top performers don't add more to their approach. They eliminate what isn't working.

### What Each Type Should Stop Doing

**Type 1:** Stop perfecting things that don't matter. Apply the "Good Enough Rule" – If it's not customer-facing or legally required, 80% quality is fine.

**Type 2:** Stop rescuing people. You're not helping; you're enabling. Set a "helping budget" of 3 assists per day.

**Type 3:** Stop measuring everything. Pick 3 metrics that matter. Ignore the rest.

**Type 4:** Stop waiting for the perfect emotional state. Schedule decisions for 9 AM regardless of mood.

**Type 5:** Stop researching past the point of diminishing returns. Set a research timer: 2 hours max per decision.

**Type 6:** Stop seeking more input. After 3 opinions, decide. More data won't reduce your anxiety.

**Type 7:** Stop starting new things. Finish one thing completely before beginning another.

**Type 8:** Stop fighting every battle. Ask: "Will this matter in 6 months?" If no, let it go.

**Type 9:** Stop polling everyone. Make 3 decisions daily without consensus.

The counterintuitive part: effective leaders do less, not more. Each elimination creates space for what actually matters.

## The Uncomfortable Conversation Framework

<!-- {#uncomfortable-conversations} -->

Here's a script for the conversation your type avoids. (For more on [how each type communicates](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-communication-styles), see our communication guide.)

### The 5-Sentence Format That Works

**Sentence 1: The Observation**
"I've noticed [specific behavior] happening [frequency]."

**Sentence 2: The Impact**
"The effect has been [specific consequence]."

**Sentence 3: The Request**
"Going forward, I need [specific change]."

**Sentence 4: The Check-In**
"What's your perspective on this?"

**Sentence 5: The Agreement**
"So we're agreed that [specific next step]?"

### Type-Specific Conversation Triggers

**Type 1:** Having to lower your standards
_Your script:_ "I've noticed we're spending 40% of our time perfecting details that customers don't see. The effect has been missing three deadlines. Going forward, I need us to apply the 80/20 rule. What's your perspective on this?"

**Type 2:** Setting boundaries with needy team members
_Your script:_ "I've noticed you've come to me 5 times today for approval on routine decisions. The effect has been I can't focus on strategic work. Going forward, I need you to make these decisions yourself and update me weekly. What's your perspective?"

**Type 3:** Admitting failure or weakness
_Your script:_ "I've noticed I've been prioritizing speed over team wellbeing. The effect has been two resignations. Going forward, I need to balance results with relationships better. What's your perspective on how I can improve?"

**Type 4:** Addressing your emotional impact
_Your script:_ "I've noticed my mood shifts affect team energy. The effect has been inconsistent productivity. Going forward, I'll share my emotional state at meeting starts so you know it's not about you. What's your perspective?"

**Type 5:** Giving emotional support
_Your script:_ "I've noticed you seem stressed about the project. The effect might be affecting your work quality. Going forward, I want to offer more support. What's your perspective on what you need?"

**Type 6:** Making decisions without consensus
_Your script:_ "I've noticed we've discussed this issue four times without deciding. The effect has been lost momentum. Going forward, I'm making the call to proceed with Option A. What's your perspective on implementation?"

**Type 7:** Delivering negative feedback
_Your script:_ "I've noticed the last three projects were started but not completed. The effect has been team frustration. Going forward, I need us to finish current work before starting new initiatives. What's your perspective?"

**Type 8:** Showing vulnerability
_Your script:_ "I've noticed I've been bulldozing through discussions. The effect has been people stopping sharing ideas. Going forward, I need to listen more before deciding. What's your perspective on how I can improve?"

**Type 9:** Taking a strong stance
_Your script:_ "I've noticed we keep deferring this decision to keep everyone happy. The effect has been competitive disadvantage. Going forward, I'm deciding we proceed with the controversial option. What's your perspective on managing reactions?"

### The 72-Hour Rule

If you don't have the conversation within 72 hours of recognizing the need, you probably never will. Set a reminder. Schedule it. Do it scared.

## What Each Type Fears Most

<!-- {#fears} -->

Tim Ferriss observed: _"What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do."_

Every type has a core fear that shapes their leadership blind spot:

- **Type 1:** Being imperfect or wrong
- **Type 2:** Being unloved or unneeded
- **Type 3:** Being worthless or failing
- **Type 4:** Being ordinary or insignificant
- **Type 5:** Being incompetent or overwhelmed
- **Type 6:** Being without support or guidance
- **Type 7:** Being trapped in pain or boredom
- **Type 8:** Being controlled or vulnerable
- **Type 9:** Conflict and separation

Your fear drives your overcompensation. Name it and you can work with it instead of around it.

## Your Next Move

<!-- {#next-move} -->

1. **Identify your type** if you haven't (our [beginner's guide](/enneagram-corner/beginners-guide-to-determining-your-enneagram-type) can help)
2. **Write down one uncomfortable conversation you've been avoiding**
3. **Pick one thing from your type's elimination list to stop doing this week**
4. **Have the conversation within 48 hours**

Tim Ferriss again: _"The superheroes you have in your mind are nearly all walking flaws who've maximized one or two strengths."_

You don't need to be a perfect leader. You need to be your type of leader, aware of your patterns and willing to address them.

The Enneagram doesn't put you in a box. It shows you the box you're already operating from, so you can choose when to stay in it and when to step out.
