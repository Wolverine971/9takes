<!-- 3 step plan for personal growth -->

<!-- A Fresh Approach: Enneagram and Personal Growth -->

<p class="firstLetter">Trying to plan a great event? Have you considered the personality types that you might be attending?</p>

Are the people in the group your close friends who love and support you? Or is the group a bunch of intellectual types who are going to need some social lubrication? Who might cause problems, and who wants to help? Who will be silently judging you, and who will be hitting on everyone?

Here, we will explore the personality types that might attend your event and try to help you throw a great party.

## One Approach to Party Planning

Imagine Alex, an Enneagram 3, "the achiever," who is busy meticulously planning a party. For Alex, this isn't just about hosting a fun gathering; it's an opportunity to show off. The party must be a resounding success in every aspect and, ideally, should be the talk of the town for weeks to come. Needless to say, a sparsely attended event would be a disappointment and a big blow to Alex's self-image.

Alex takes immense pride in his connections and abilities. He aims to leave guests in awe and is likely throwing this party as a means to an end. Every detail, from the choice of venue, menu, and music to the overall ambiance, is carefully curated to align with Alex's vision and create the outcome he desires.

Alex is thinking about who to invite. Who will increase his clout? He is very aware of the impressive individuals he has access to or wants to get access to. And a party is a perfect excuse to get access to the people he is after.

Do you know someone like Alex who might approach planning a party this way? Is Alex similar to or different from you?

Be sure to consider your motivations for throwing a party and then think about what your guests want out of this party.

### The Invite Strategy

Assuming you have considered your own motivations lets think about the reasons why different personalities go to a party.

Each Enneagram type approaches a party differently and has unique motivations and desires. For instance, if a Type 1, "The Reformer/ The Perfectionist," is invited to a party, to them, the party is likely serving some utility. The party likely has a clear purpose, and they already have expectations for how the party should go. Meanwhile, a Type 7- "Enthusiast", will likely show up for any party as long as there is the possibility of fun.

Lets dive into how you would entice each Enneagram type to attend your party.
