We all know that people have different strengths and weaknesses. We know that identifying them could be the key to personal growth, building relationships, and achieving success. However it gets tricky when trying to determine the various dimensions by which we can see what we are good and bad at. The Enneagram takes an interesting approach in figuring this out.

### Understanding Your Energizers and Drainers

Many enneagram authors talk about energizers and drainers. Have you ever noticed how certain activities energize you while others drain you? This can clue us into identifying our strengths and weaknesses. What energizes one person may drain another. Some people love public speaking, while others dread it. Some people thrive in social situations and want the party to never end, while other people have an internal social meter that they are monitoring closely.

Let's take a look at common energizers and drainers for each Enneagram type then we can extrapolate their strengths and weaknesses and a hypothetical career situation.
