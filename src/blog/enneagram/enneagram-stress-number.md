## Understanding your place of comfort and stress

Each Enneagram type has a place of comfort and a place of stress. Your place of comfort is the number on the Enneagram that describes your natural state of being. It's where you feel most at home, where you're most comfortable in your own skin. Your place of stress, on the other hand, is the number that represents the opposite of your natural state. It's where you feel most out of place, where you're most likely to struggle.

Knowing your stress number can be incredibly valuable because it helps you understand yourself better. When you're in a place of stress, you're likely to experience all sorts of negative emotions, such as anxiety, frustration, anger or feeling like everyone is against you. You might also exhibit behavior that you're not proud of, such as being controlling, manipulative, or passive-aggressive. Mentally and emotionally when you are in that state you start acting like another enneagram type.

## Why it's hard to interact with enneagram types that are your stress number

The thing about your stress number is that it's the number that you act like when you are at your worst. It can be hard to interact with people who are your stress number because you might recognize the toxic parts of yourself in that Enneagram type. It is also possible that when you're around that enneagram type, it can trigger your own negative tendencies. You might not even recognize your stress number at first because it might be the number that you least identify with. However, if you pay attention to how you react to stress, you'll start to see patterns that indicate your stress number.

For example, if you're an Enneagram Type 1, your place of stress is Enneagram Type 4. Type 4s are creative, emotional, and intuitive, and can be insecure about their identity which can be a stark contrast to the rational, logical, principled and self assured Type 1. When you're under stress, you might find yourself having an identity crisis and feeling moody.

If you're an Enneagram Type 9, your place of stress is Enneagram Type 6. Type 6s are loyal, skeptical, and anxious, and endlessly examining all worst case scenarios which can be challenging for the peaceful, easy-going Type 9. When you're under stress, you might find yourself acting overthinking things and becoming hype fixated on minute details.

If you're a Type 5, your stress number is Type 7. Type 7s are enthusiastic, adventurous, fun-loving and try to avoid pain by distracting themselves, which can be a stark contrast to the introverted, analytical, and serious Type 5. When you're under stress, you might find yourself acting more impulsively and being irrationally optimistic.

## Expanding on the examples for each Enneagram type

Let's take a closer look at each Enneagram type's stress number and what it means for them:

Type 1: Your stress number is Type 4. Type 4s are creative, emotional, and intuitive. When you're under stress, you might become moody, depressed, and isolate yourself from others. You might also become more self-critical and judgmental, as well as have difficulty accepting and expressing your emotions.

Type 2: Your stress number is Type 8. Type 8s are powerful, assertive, and confrontational. When you're under stress, you might become more aggressive and controlling, as well as overprotective and demanding of others. You might also struggle with feeling unappreciated or neglected by those around you.

Type 3: Your stress number is Type 9. Type 9s are peaceful, accommodating, and harmonious. When you're under stress, you might become more withdrawn and passive, as well as avoidant and indecisive. You might also struggle with feeling unimportant or insignificant in the eyes of others.

Type 4: Your stress number is Type 2. Type 2s are generous, caring, and nurturing. When you're under stress, you might become more emotionally needy and dependent on others, as well as manipulative and controlling in your relationships. You might also struggle with feeling unlovable or inadequate.

Type 5: Your stress number is Type 7. Type 7s are enthusiastic, spontaneous, and adventurous. When you're under stress, you might become more impulsive and more easily distracted, as well as struggle with feeling overwhelmed and out of control. You might also have difficulty focusing on one thing at a time and making decisions.

Type 6: Your stress number is Type 3. Type 3s are ambitious, competitive, and driven. When you're under stress, you might become more obsessed with success and achievement, as well as competitive and envious of others. You might also struggle with feeling anxious and insecure about your abilities and worth.

Type 7: Your stress number is Type 1. Type 1s are principled, ethical, and perfectionistic. When you're under stress, you might become more critical and judgmental of yourself and others, as well as rigid and inflexible in your thinking. You might also struggle with feeling anxious and overwhelmed by the demands of life.

Type 8: Your stress number is Type 5. Type 5s are analytical, independent, and private. When you're under stress, you might become more withdrawn and isolated from others, as well as cold and distant in your relationships. You might also struggle with feeling vulnerable and helpless in the face of challenges.

Type 9: Your stress number is Type 6. Type 6s are loyal, responsible, and anxious. When you're under stress, you might become more fearful and paranoid, as well as indecisive and hesitant. You might also struggle with feeling uncertain and insecure about the future.
