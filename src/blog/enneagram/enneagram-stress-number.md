<p class="firstLetter" >Everyone gets stressed, but how people act when stressed differs a lot. Why is that?</p>

TLDR: It's because specific personalities are sensitive to specific emotions, and when specific situations cause them to feel that emotion, they lash out. You might be surprised to learn that the reasons people lash out are not as complex as you might think. Lashing out is due to something making us feel one of these three emotions: anger, fear, or shame.

Here, we are going to use the Enneagram to understand why these emotions come up and learn how to mitigate the lashing out.

<!-- out that emotion these have been developed overtime starting from childhood.  -->

<!-- From time to time, we all lash out out of anger, fear, or embarrassment but that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the build up before the lashing out. How does a person act, think and feel **before lashing out**, when we are stressed. The Enneagram describes how we act when stressed and says that we take on the negative aspects of another personality when stressed. -->

<!-- The Enneagram describes stress in detail by differentiating how a person normally is (our personality type) compared to how they are when stressed. According to the Enneagram we take on the negative aspects of another personality type when we are stressed. -->

<!-- Since there are 9 different Enneagram personality types, the personality type that you go to when you aren't doing well (aka the path of disintegration) is called your stress number.

And that is what we will be exploring below- stress numbers. -->

## What everyone gets wrong about stress

Many people don't see a buildup of stress until it's too late.

You are in the minority if you have taken the time to dive into the reasons behind why you got stressed or why you lashed out. Many people blame the situation and circumstances and do not recognize the emotion that was triggered inside them. It is not the situation. It's the emotions we feel in response to the situation.

- something makes someone worried
- something makes someone feel anger
- something makes someone feel embarrassed

Again, it's not the situation; it's the emotions triggered by the situation. The situation may change, but if the emotion gets triggered again, you will get stressed.

<!-- Different situations bring up different emotions for people. -->

<!-- People do not always see the build up of the. Its too late -->

## Situations change, but emotions do not

Have you ever heard someone say, "That's not me" or "That is not the real me"?

Yes, it is. It's the darker side of you. In some circles, it is called your "shadow side." In Enneagram circles, it's called your stress number or your path of disintegration. People say, "That is not me," because they don't like how they acted and don't identify with what they did in that situation.

But it's still part of you, and it will happen again.

<!-- ## The Other Side of Stress: Comfort

Its not all bad. Because different things stress people out, different things also bring people comfort.

The Enneagram is made up of connecting lines. One line goes to your place of stress. And the other line goes to your place of comfort. When you are doing well and feeling confident you start taking on the positive aspects of another personality on the Enneagram. And when feeling stressed you take on the negative aspects of another personality.

Here we will be diving into the darker parts of your personality and uncovering your stress number. -->

<!-- ## Understanding your Stress Number- stops the negative patterns

It shines a light on those moments when you're not quite yourself- anxious, frustrated, or a bit toxic. We are going to
