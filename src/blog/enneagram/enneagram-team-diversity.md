<p class="firstLetter">Your team says they want "diverse perspectives." What they actually have is six people who think identically and two who stopped speaking up.</p>

Remember high school? Jocks with jocks. Nerds with nerds. Drama kids in their corner. Fast forward to your workplace — it's the exact same dynamic with business casual.

**Teams self-select for similarity.** It's comfortable. It's efficient. It's also why your "brainstorms" produce the same three ideas every time.

Groupthink isn't a failure of effort. It's the default outcome when you let teams form organically. Everyone hires people they "click with" — which means people who think like them.

**The Enneagram reveals what your team is actually missing.**

## The Enneagram Triads: Three Ways Teams Break Down

The Enneagram groups types into triads. Each triad reveals a different dimension of how people operate. Understanding these explains why certain people clash (or click) instantly.

### How People Take Up Space

Some people walk into a meeting and immediately start talking. Others wait to be asked. Others zone out entirely unless directly engaged.

- **The Drivers (3, 7, 8)**: They take charge. They speak first. They push for action.
- **The Collaborators (1, 2, 6)**: They seek buy-in. They want everyone on the same page before moving forward.
- **The Observers (4, 5, 9)**: They process internally. They need time before contributing. If you don't explicitly invite them in, they stay quiet.

**The problem**: If your team is all Drivers, you get conflict and competition. All Collaborators? Nothing gets decided. All Observers? Brilliant ideas never surface.

### How People Handle Conflict

When problems arise, people default to different modes:

- **Logic Mode (1, 3, 5)**: "Let's analyze this objectively. What are the facts?"
- **Emotional Mode (4, 6, 8)**: "I need to be heard. I need you to understand why this matters."
- **Positive Mode (2, 7, 9)**: "Let's focus on what's working. Let's not dwell on the negative."

**The clash**: Logic Mode dismisses Emotional Mode as "too dramatic." Emotional Mode sees Logic Mode as "cold." Positive Mode frustrates both by "not taking things seriously."

### How People Connect (or Don't)

- **Connection Seekers (3, 6, 9)**: They need validation. They want to belong.
- **Frustration Types (1, 4, 7)**: Something always feels missing. They're searching for the ideal.
- **Boundary Types (2, 5, 8)**: They control access to themselves, either by pushing in or pulling away.

Understanding these patterns prevents you from taking things personally. That coworker isn't cold; they're a Type 5 conserving energy. That team member isn't clingy; they're a Type 6 seeking security.

## Enneagram Combinations: The Power of Diversity

Different Enneagram combinations can create unique team dynamics. By intentionally combining diverse types, teams can leverage a wide range of strengths and perspectives.

Consider an "**Innovative Thinkers**" team comprising Type 5 (The Investigator), Type 7 (The Enthusiast), and Type 1 (The Perfectionist). This combination fosters a dynamic environment where innovative ideas are generated, evaluated, and refined to ensure high-quality outcomes. The Investigator brings depth of knowledge, the Enthusiast contributes creative energy, and the Perfectionist ensures precision in execution.

A "**Compassionate Problem Solvers**" team might combine Type 2 (The Helper), Type 6 (The Loyalist), and Type 9 (The Peacemaker). This group excels at understanding others' needs and developing inclusive solutions. The Helper brings emotional intelligence, the Loyalist contributes strategic thinking, and the Peacemaker ensures all perspectives are considered.

For an "**Ambitious Achievers**" team, consider Types 3 (The Achiever), 4 (The Individualist), and 8 (The Challenger). This combination nurtures a competitive atmosphere where team members push each other to maximize their potential while maintaining a strong sense of identity and purpose.

By understanding these dynamics, leaders can strategically compose teams to address specific challenges or goals. The key is to balance different strengths and perspectives to create a well-rounded, high-performing team.

## Using the Enneagram to Address Key Team Issues

The Enneagram provides a pathway to address critical team issues such as diversity of thought, inclusive language, and perspective-taking.

### Diversity of Thought: Leveraging Different Mental Models

The Enneagram reveals how different types approach problems and generate ideas. By understanding these diverse thinking styles, teams can assign roles that leverage each type's strengths. For instance, a Type 5 might excel at in-depth research, while a Type 7 could lead brainstorming sessions. Type 1s might be best suited for quality control and refinement of ideas.

To maximize diversity of thought, create processes that accommodate different processing styles. This might involve:

- A mix of individual reflection time and group discussions
- Alternating between structured and free-form ideation sessions
- Rotating leadership roles to ensure different perspectives guide the team

By intentionally incorporating diverse thinking styles, teams can generate more innovative and comprehensive solutions to complex problems.

### Inclusive Language: Speaking Everyone's Language

Different [Enneagram types](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-tldr) respond to and use language differently. To create a more inclusive environment, tailor communication styles to suit different types. For example, Competency types might appreciate clear, logical explanations, while Reactive types might respond better to emotionally resonant language.

Use a mix of communication channels to ensure all team members feel comfortable expressing their ideas. This could include written reports for those who process information best in writing, verbal discussions for those who think best out loud, and one-on-one check-ins for those who prefer more intimate communication settings.

### Perspective Taking: Walking in Another's Shoes

The Enneagram offers a framework for understanding others' viewpoints. Use Enneagram insights to anticipate potential conflicts and address them proactively. For instance, a Type 8's directness might clash with a Type 9's desire for harmony. By understanding these tendencies, team leaders can mediate effectively.

Foster a culture of curiosity about different personality types and their unique contributions. This might involve regular team exercises where members share their perspectives on a given issue, explicitly framed through their Enneagram lens.

## The Power of Open-Ended Questions

The key to unlocking the benefits of a diverse team lies in asking better questions. Open-ended questions serve as a practical tool for understanding and improving team dynamics.

Start with "How" and "Why" questions to prompt explanation and exploration. "How can we improve our team collaboration?" encourages team members to think critically about current processes and potential improvements. Follow up with "What" questions to explore ideas and opinions. "What challenges have you faced in this project?" allows team members to share their unique experiences and insights.

To dig deeper, consider using these types of questions:

- Elaboration requests: "Can you tell me more about your approach to problem-solving?"
- Reflective questions: "Why do you believe this strategy is best for our team?"
- Emotion-focused questions: "How do you feel about our recent changes?"
- Experience-based questions: "Can you share a time when you learned from a failure?"

By consistently using these types of questions, teams can foster open communication, uncover blind spots, and leverage the full spectrum of perspectives within the group.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Building a genuinely diverse team is uncomfortable. By design.

**If everyone "gets along" immediately, you probably hired the same person nine times.**

Real diversity means:

- Type 8s pushing back hard while Type 9s wish everyone would calm down
- Type 5s wanting more data while Type 7s want to move faster
- Type 1s focused on quality while Type 3s focus on speed

These tensions aren't problems to solve. They're features to leverage.

**Start here:**

1. Map your team's current Enneagram composition
2. Identify what's missing (usually the types that "wouldn't fit in")
3. Hire for the discomfort you need, not the comfort you want

The teams that win aren't the ones that avoid friction. They're the ones that learned how to use it.

What type is your team missing?
