<p class="firstLetter">People say they want diversity but do not realize how hard it is to get it because that most teams by their nature are not diverse.</p>

Remember high school? The jocks, the nerds, the drama kids - all huddled in their cozy cliques. Fast forward to your workplace, and it's d√©j√† vu all over again.

Teams naturally form their own little ecosystems. People gravitate towards those who think and act like them. It's comfortable, it's familiar, but it's also a breeding ground for groupthink. This self-selection isn't inherently bad. It's human nature. But it can lead to blind spots that hinder a team's full potential.

There's a solution to this challenge that's both obvious and nuanced. But before we dive into that, let's explore why diverse teams matter and how the Enneagram can help us build them.

## The Enneagram Triads: Decoding Communication Styles

The Enneagram offers three key groupings that illuminate different communication styles. These triads provide insight into how team members interact, cope with challenges, and relate to others.

### Hornevian Groups: How We Engage with the World

The Hornevian groups, named after psychoanalyst Karen Horney, describe how types interact with others and their environment. These groups reveal whether a person tends to move towards, away from, or against others in their interactions.

- Assertives (Types 3, 7, 8): Direct, action-oriented communicators who often take charge in conversations.
- Compliants (Types 1, 2, 6): Collaborative communicators who seek consensus and harmony in discussions.
- Withdrawn (Types 4, 5, 9): Reflective communicators who may need time to process before contributing.

Understanding these engagement styles can help teams balance leadership and collaboration effectively. By recognizing each member's natural tendencies, teams can create an environment where all voices are heard and valued.

### Harmonic Groups: How We Handle Conflict

Harmonic groups reflect how types cope with difficulty and conflict. These groups provide insight into a person's default response when faced with challenges or disagreements.

- Competency Types (1, 3, 5) approach problems logically, valuing efficiency and objectivity.
- Reactive Types (4, 6, 8) are emotionally expressive, seeking understanding and validation.
- Positive Outlook Types (2, 7, 9) focus on possibilities and silver linings, often trying to maintain harmony.

Recognizing these coping mechanisms can help teams navigate conflicts more smoothly and leverage different problem-solving approaches. By understanding each member's default conflict style, teams can develop strategies to address disagreements constructively.

### Object Relations: How We Connect with Others

Object Relations groups, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, describe core relational issues. These groups shed light on how individuals form and maintain relationships within the team.

- Attachment Types (3, 6, 9): Seek connection and validation from others.
- Frustration Types (1, 4, 7): Often feel a sense of inner lack or missing piece.
- Rejection Types (2, 5, 8): May struggle with closeness, either pushing away or withdrawing.

Understanding these relational patterns can foster empathy and improve team bonding. By recognizing each member's attachment style, teams can create an environment that supports healthy relationships and collaboration.

## Enneagram Combinations: The Power of Diversity

Different Enneagram combinations can create unique team dynamics. By intentionally combining diverse types, teams can leverage a wide range of strengths and perspectives.

Consider an "**Innovative Thinkers**" team comprising Type 5 (The Investigator), Type 7 (The Enthusiast), and Type 1 (The Perfectionist). This combination fosters a dynamic environment where innovative ideas are generated, evaluated, and refined to ensure high-quality outcomes. The Investigator brings depth of knowledge, the Enthusiast contributes creative energy, and the Perfectionist ensures precision in execution.

A "**Compassionate Problem Solvers**" team might combine Type 2 (The Helper), Type 6 (The Loyalist), and Type 9 (The Peacemaker). This group excels at understanding others' needs and developing inclusive solutions. The Helper brings emotional intelligence, the Loyalist contributes strategic thinking, and the Peacemaker ensures all perspectives are considered.

For an "**Ambitious Achievers**" team, consider Types 3 (The Achiever), 4 (The Individualist), and 8 (The Challenger). This combination nurtures a competitive atmosphere where team members push each other to maximize their potential while maintaining a strong sense of identity and purpose.

By understanding these dynamics, leaders can strategically compose teams to address specific challenges or goals. The key is to balance different strengths and perspectives to create a well-rounded, high-performing team.

## Using the Enneagram to Address Key Team Issues

The Enneagram provides a pathway to address critical team issues such as diversity of thought, inclusive language, and perspective-taking.

### Diversity of Thought: Leveraging Different Mental Models

The Enneagram reveals how different types approach problems and generate ideas. By understanding these diverse thinking styles, teams can assign roles that leverage each type's strengths. For instance, a Type 5 might excel at in-depth research, while a Type 7 could lead brainstorming sessions. Type 1s might be best suited for quality control and refinement of ideas.

To maximize diversity of thought, create processes that accommodate different processing styles. This might involve:

- A mix of individual reflection time and group discussions
- Alternating between structured and free-form ideation sessions
- Rotating leadership roles to ensure different perspectives guide the team

By intentionally incorporating diverse thinking styles, teams can generate more innovative and comprehensive solutions to complex problems.

### Inclusive Language: Speaking Everyone's Language

Different Enneagram types respond to and use language differently. To create a more inclusive environment, tailor communication styles to suit different types. For example, Competency types might appreciate clear, logical explanations, while Reactive types might respond better to emotionally resonant language.

Use a mix of communication channels to ensure all team members feel comfortable expressing their ideas. This could include written reports for those who process information best in writing, verbal discussions for those who think best out loud, and one-on-one check-ins for those who prefer more intimate communication settings.

### Perspective Taking: Walking in Another's Shoes

The Enneagram offers a framework for understanding others' viewpoints. Use Enneagram insights to anticipate potential conflicts and address them proactively. For instance, a Type 8's directness might clash with a Type 9's desire for harmony. By understanding these tendencies, team leaders can mediate effectively.

Foster a culture of curiosity about different personality types and their unique contributions. This might involve regular team exercises where members share their perspectives on a given issue, explicitly framed through their Enneagram lens.

## The Power of Open-Ended Questions

The key to unlocking the benefits of a diverse team lies in asking better questions. Open-ended questions serve as a practical tool for understanding and improving team dynamics.

Start with "How" and "Why" questions to prompt explanation and exploration. "How can we improve our team collaboration?" encourages team members to think critically about current processes and potential improvements. Follow up with "What" questions to explore ideas and opinions. "What challenges have you faced in this project?" allows team members to share their unique experiences and insights.

To dig deeper, consider using these types of questions:

- Elaboration requests: "Can you tell me more about your approach to problem-solving?"
- Reflective questions: "Why do you believe this strategy is best for our team?"
- Emotion-focused questions: "How do you feel about our recent changes?"
- Experience-based questions: "Can you share a time when you learned from a failure?"

By consistently using these types of questions, teams can foster open communication, uncover blind spots, and leverage the full spectrum of perspectives within the group.

## Putting It All Together

Building stronger, more diverse teams is an ongoing process that requires intentional effort and continuous learning.

Start by using the Enneagram to understand your team's composition. Identify potential blind spots based on your team's Enneagram mix. Then, implement open-ended questioning techniques to foster better communication. Regularly assess and adjust your approach to maintain a balance of perspectives.

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate differences, but to leverage them. By embracing the diversity that different Enneagram types bring to the table and fostering open communication, you can transform your team from a high school clique into a powerhouse of innovation and collaboration.
