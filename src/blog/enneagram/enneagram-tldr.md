<p class="firstLetter">The Enneagram is a personality typing system that categorizes people into nine different types based on their core motivations, fears, and desires. Each type has its own distinct traits and tendencies, and understanding your Enneagram type can provide insight into your personality, behavior, and relationships.</p>

There are 3 groups or divisions in the Enneagram called triads. These triads are divided by 3 core emotions which corelate to special intelligences.  The emotions are anger, fear and shame. And the unique intelligences corelate with the emotions are the following:

- Fear- Intellectual intelligence
- Shame- Emotional intelligence
- Anger- Instinctual intelligence

Each enneagram type deals with their core emotion in different ways. Either they actively use that emotion to motivate them. Or they feel that emotion and try to suppress it. Or they are unaware of that emotions impact and it lives in their subconscious.

The following are the 9 Enneagram types.

## How to Determine Your Enneagram Type

While online tests can provide a starting point for determining your Enneagram type, the most effective way to identify your type is through self-reflection and introspection. Here are some tips to help you determine your Enneagram type:

1. Consider your core motivations and fears: Each Enneagram type is motivated by a core desire and is driven by a core fear. Reflect on what drives you and what you are afraid of, and see which type aligns with your deepest motivations and fears.

2. Identify your core traits: Each Enneagram type has a set of core traits that define their personality. Consider your strengths and weaknesses and see which type‚Äôs traits most closely match your own.

3. Consider your childhood experiences: Our childhood experiences can shape our personality and behavior. Reflect on your upbringing and see how it may have influenced your Enneagram type.

4. Seek outside opinions: Ask friends, family, and colleagues for their feedback on your personality traits and tendencies. They may offer insight into your Enneagram type that you may not have considered.
