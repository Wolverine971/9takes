<p class="firstLetter">The Enneagram is a personality typing system that categorizes people into nine types.</p>

It is based on core motivations, fears, and childhood trauma. Each Enneagram type has distinct traits and tendencies, and understanding your Enneagram type can provide insight into your personality, behavior, and relationships.

**The 9 Enneagram types are divided up into 3 divisions in the Enneagram called triads.** The 3 triads each have a core emotion associated with them, which correlates to particular intelligence. The 3 emotions are anger, fear, and shame.

The unique intelligences connected with the emotions are the following:

- Fear- Intellectual intelligence
- Shame- Emotional intelligence
- Anger- Instinctual intelligence

Each Enneagram type deals with or copes with their core emotion in different ways. Either they actively use that emotion to motivate them. Or they feel that emotion and try to suppress it. Or they are unaware of the impact of that emotion, and it lives in their subconscious.

The following are the 9 Enneagram types.

## How to Determine Your Enneagram type

While online tests can provide a starting point for determining your Enneagram type, **the most effective way to identify your type is through self-reflection and introspection.** Here are some tips to help you determine your Enneagram type:

1. Consider your core motivations and fears: Each Enneagram type is motivated by a core desire and is driven by a core fear. Reflect on what drives you and what you are afraid of, and see which type aligns with your deepest motivations and fears.

2. Identify your core traits: Each Enneagram type has a set of core traits that define their personality. Consider your strengths and weaknesses and see which type’s traits most closely match your own. <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-strengths-and-weaknesses">Checkout each type's strengths and weaknesses here</a>.

3. Consider your childhood experiences: Our childhood experiences can shape our personality and behavior. Reflect on your upbringing and see how it may have influenced your Enneagram type. Checkout <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-childhood-stereotypes">how each type was in their childhood here</a>.

4. Seek outside opinions: Ask friends, family, and colleagues for their feedback on your personality traits and tendencies. They may offer insight into your Enneagram type that you may not have considered.
