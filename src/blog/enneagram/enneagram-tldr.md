<!-- MIDJOURNEY PROMPTS

Hero Image - Speed Reading the Enneagram:
Greek statue in modern library speed-reading through massive ancient tome with marble fingers tracing lines of text, pages flying and floating around the statue caught mid-air showing personality diagrams, stopwatch on desk showing 5 minutes, stack of discarded lengthy psychology textbooks pushed aside, focused marble expression with slight smirk, dramatic library lighting through tall windows, shallow depth of field, lifestyle photography --ar 16:9 --v 6

Alternative - The Quick Study:
Greek statue at minimalist desk with single-page cheat sheet in marble hands, nine sticky notes arranged in enneagram pattern on wall behind with one-word descriptions, coffee cup with steam, smartphone timer showing 5:00, other thick books closed and stacked as armrest, morning light streaming through window, modern workspace, documentary photography style --ar 16:9 --v 6

<p class="firstLetter">That personality test was wrong because it measured behavior, not motivation.</p>

**See the emotions behind every take.** The Enneagram reveals the WHY behind people's actions—nine core emotional patterns that drive all human behavior. Master these patterns and you'll decode anyone in seconds.

Your complete personality-maxing cheat sheet: each type's core drive, blind spot, and the exact words that make them light up or shut down.

> "She's not 'being difficult'—Type 1s need things done right the first time. Match their precision and watch the resistance disappear."

**Try this tonight**: Pick someone who confuses you. Find their type below. Notice how their "difficult" behavior suddenly makes perfect emotional sense.

## Find Your Enneagram Type: Skip the Tests, Use Pattern Recognition

Online tests measure behavior—you need to map your core emotional patterns. **Focus on your automatic responses under stress**, not how you think you should act.

**Quick identification method**:

→ **Track your gut reactions**: What triggers instant annoyance or fear?  
→ **Notice your defense patterns**: How do you protect yourself when threatened?  
→ **Identify your childhood coping**: What strategy got you safety/love as a kid?  
→ **Watch your energy drains**: What social situations exhaust you most?

**Pro tip**: Ask people close to you what motivates your behavior—they often see patterns you miss.
