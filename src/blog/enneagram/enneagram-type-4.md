<h2 id="stress">🤯 Enneagram 4s Under Stress</h2>

Type 4s under stress go to 2. The <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-2">type 2</a> is generous, caring, and nurturing. When the type 2 is under stress, they become more emotionally needy and dependent on others. They can also become manipulative and controlling in their relationships.

They also might become a people pleaser to gain approval. If their motional needs are not being met they may resort to manipulative tactics, such as guilt-tripping or playing the victim, to gain sympathy and attention.
