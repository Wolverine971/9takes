<QuickAnswer question="Why can't Type 6s stop worrying?">
Because your mind learned something the hard way: the ground can shift without warning. Trust got broken. Authority proved unreliable. Safety disappeared when you weren't watching. Your anxiety isn't irrational. It's pattern recognition from experience. You run every scenario through constant calculation because once, you didn't see danger coming and it cost you. The "what if" spiral isn't neurosis. It's survival-level vigilance from someone who learned that not being prepared has consequences.
</QuickAnswer>

**Read time**: 18 minutes | **Core wound**: Learning that solid ground can become quicksand

<p class="firstLetter">You remember when you stopped trusting so easily. Maybe it was a promise broken by someone who should have kept it. Maybe it was the moment you realized the adults didn't actually know what they were doing. Maybe it was following the rules perfectly and getting hurt anyway.</p>

Something cracked. The world revealed itself: a place where solid ground becomes quicksand without warning. Where those in charge might be as lost as you are. Where safety is an illusion that only survives if you don't look too closely.

So you started questioning. Not out of curiosity but out of necessity. _Can I trust this? What if they're wrong? What's the backup plan?_ The child who once trusted easily became the adult who trusts nothing easily. Including yourself.

This is Type 6 territory. You didn't choose to be anxious. You learned that vigilance is the price of survival in a world that already proved it can't be trusted.

<section class="section-content">

## The Trust Equation

You don't just think about trust. You live in constant calculation of it.

Every person, every situation, every decision runs through an algorithm you didn't consciously build: past reliability times current behavior divided by potential for betrayal equals trustworthiness score. This isn't paranoia. It's pattern recognition from someone who learned what happens when you trust without verification.

Watch yourself enter a new situation. You're not just participating. You're scanning. Exit routes. Power dynamics. Gaps between what people say and what they do. You're mapping trust in real time.

Other people call this overthinking. You call it common sense.

### The Authority Paradox

Here's the painful irony: you simultaneously crave and question authority.

You want someone competent in charge. Someone who actually knows what they're doing. But you've learned that many authorities are scared humans pretending to have answers. This creates the push-pull that exhausts you: seeking guidance while scrutinizing the guide.

You might spend years working for a boss you respect. Then one day you notice a critical error, and suddenly they're fallible. The pedestal crumbles. The search for reliable authority starts over.

</section>

<section class="section-content">

## The Loyalty Loop

For you, loyalty isn't a value. It's survival strategy.

You invest deeply in your chosen people, creating bonds strong enough to withstand the earthquakes you're always expecting. When you commit, you mean it at a level most people never reach.

But this loyalty costs you. You stay in relationships, jobs, and situations long after they've turned toxic, because leaving feels like betrayal. Of them. Of your investment. Of the future you planned together. You'd rather ride a sinking ship with trusted crew than jump to a safer vessel with strangers.

At least you know the people on this ship.

### Strengths of the Sentinel

When you're operating from a healthy place, you become:

**An early warning system.** You see problems coming while others are still celebrating. What they call pessimism, you call foresight. You're usually right.

**Reliability incarnate.** When you commit, it's carved in stone. You show up. You follow through. You stand by people when everyone else has fled.

**Courageous under fire.** The most anxious type often becomes the bravest when crisis actually arrives. You've rehearsed this moment a thousand times. When it happens, you're strangely calm.

**A community builder.** Your need for security drives you to create it for others. You build networks of mutual support. You check in on people. You remember what matters to them.

### The Shadows You Know

But perpetual vigilance casts dark shadows. You know these:

**Analysis paralysis.** Every decision spawns a thousand "what-ifs." You get stuck between scenarios, unable to move because you haven't accounted for every possibility.

**Self-fulfilling prophecies.** Testing others' loyalty pushes them away. Your fear of abandonment creates the abandonment you feared. You know this. Doesn't make it easier to stop.

**Living disasters twice.** Mental rehearsal of catastrophe doesn't prevent it. You just live through it before it happens. And again when it happens. And again when you replay it.

**The push-pull that exhausts everyone.** Needing guidance while suspecting the guide. Wanting to trust while knowing better. This cycle wears you out. It wears out the people trying to lead you, too.

## When Fear Becomes Frenzy: Under Stress

When overwhelmed, something disturbing happens. You shift toward unhealthy <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-3">Type 3</a> patterns. Your authenticity morphs into image management.

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<img loading="lazy" src="/blogs/3-6.png" class="arrow-img" alt="six going to three in stress">
</p>

The transformation jars even you. The person who valued genuineness starts performing success. The questioner becomes rigidly certain. The team player turns competitive. You stop asking "what if this goes wrong?" and start asking "how do I look like I have this handled?"

### The Stress Spiral

1. Your security strategies fail
2. Anxiety exceeds what you can manage
3. Shift from "we" to "me" thinking
4. Image becomes armor against judgment
5. Your real concerns get buried under achievements
6. Isolation increases despite surface success
7. Core fears intensify behind the facade you're maintaining

This isn't vanity. It's desperation. When your usual support systems fail, vulnerability becomes unbearable. The unconscious logic: _If I can't trust anyone else, I'll become so successful, so competent, so impressive that I won't need to depend on anyone._

Achievement becomes self-sufficiency. Image becomes armor. The loyal team player suddenly goes solo, proving they can handle everything alone.

The cruel irony: this strategy disconnects you from the relationships you need to feel secure. You push away support in a desperate attempt to prove you don't need it.

## The Childhood Betrayal

Your story contains a moment when trust broke. You might remember it clearly. Or it might have been so gradual you can't pinpoint when the shift happened.

This wasn't necessarily trauma in the conventional sense. Often, it was accumulated small betrayals. Gaps between what adults said and what they did. Rules that didn't protect. Authorities who were obviously lost but kept pretending otherwise.

### The Vigilant Child

You became the child who noticed when mom said "everything's fine" with tears in her eyes. Who saw dad's hands shake while insisting he had everything under control. Who recognized that the teacher didn't actually know the answer but wouldn't admit it.

This created a burden no child should carry: knowing the adults weren't really in charge, but still having to depend on them.

### Common Six Origin Patterns

- **The unreliable protector**: A parent who was sometimes loving, sometimes absent or frightening. You learned to read moods like weather forecasts. Unpredictability taught you that even love can't be trusted consistently.

- **The reversed roles**: You became the caretaker. Emotionally steadying a parent, mediating family conflict, shouldering adult concerns. Those who should protect you needed protection themselves.

- **The rule betrayal**: You followed the rules perfectly and got hurt anyway. Or watched rule-followers get punished while rule-breakers went free. The system was supposed to be fair. It wasn't.

- **The sudden shift**: Divorce, death, move, or financial crisis that shattered stability overnight. One day the ground was solid. The next day it wasn't.

The specific story varies. The lesson is the same: _The world cannot be trusted to stay safe. You must stay alert._

## Two Flavors of Fear: Phobic vs Counterphobic

This is the most misunderstood part of being a Six. The type looks radically different depending on how you learned to handle fear.

**Phobic Sixes** move away from what scares them. They seek allies, build coalitions, look for protective structures. At work, they double-check decisions with three people before acting. In relationships, they need reassurance and don't hide it. When danger appears, they prepare, plan, seek backup.

**Counterphobic Sixes** move toward what scares them. They challenge threats head-on, often appearing aggressive or reckless. At work, they question leadership in meetings, play devil's advocate on every proposal. In relationships, they pick fights to test if you'll stay. Attacking fear feels better than running from it.

### How This Plays Out

**In the workplace:**

- _Phobic_: Builds alliances, seeks consensus, worries about job security, needs clear expectations, excels at risk assessment
- _Counterphobic_: Challenges authority publicly, takes on risky projects to prove something, becomes the whistleblower, pushes back against bad ideas even when it's politically stupid to do so

**In relationships:**

- _Phobic_: Asks "are we okay?" frequently, seeks physical proximity when anxious, shares worries openly, needs verbal reassurance
- _Counterphobic_: Creates distance when scared, picks fights instead of admitting fear, tests partners by withdrawing to see who pursues, mistakes intensity for intimacy

**Under stress:**

- _Phobic_: Becomes more clingy and dependent, seeks more reassurance, catastrophizes openly
- _Counterphobic_: Becomes more aggressive and confrontational, takes bigger risks, dismisses their own fear as weakness

Most Sixes contain both tendencies, shifting between them depending on domain. You might be counterphobic at work (challenging your boss, taking on risky projects) but phobic in relationships (needing constant reassurance from your partner). The core fear is identical. The coping strategy varies.

</section>

<section class="section-content">

## The Devil's Advocate Reflex

There's a behavior so common in Sixes it deserves its own section: the compulsion to argue the opposite position.

Someone proposes an idea. Your instinct is to find the holes. Not because you disagree. Because you need to stress-test it. If it can't survive your scrutiny, it's not safe to rely on.

This makes you invaluable in certain contexts: legal teams, risk management, quality assurance, security consulting. You catch what everyone else missed.

But it exhausts everyone else. Your partner shares an exciting opportunity, and your first response is listing everything that could go wrong. Your friend announces a decision, and you present counterarguments they didn't ask for. You're not trying to be negative. You're protecting them from the landmines you can see.

They don't experience it that way.

### Projection: Your Mind's Trick

There's another pattern you might not recognize: projecting your suspicions onto others.

You worry you're incompetent, so you assume your boss thinks you're incompetent. You feel disloyal for considering a new job, so you imagine your team resents you. You doubt your own trustworthiness, so you question everyone else's.

This creates a hall of mirrors where your fears echo back as other people's judgments. The criticism you hear isn't always real. Sometimes it's your inner critic wearing someone else's face.

### What Sixes Get Wrong About Themselves

**"I'm just being realistic."** Sometimes you are. Sometimes you're catastrophizing and calling it prudence. The test: would someone who cares about you and has good judgment see it the same way?

**"I don't need anyone."** (Counterphobic Sixes especially.) You do. Fierce independence is often defense against the vulnerability of needing others. Strength isn't never needing. It's knowing when to lean.

**"They can tell I'm incompetent."** Your self-doubt projects outward. Most people aren't scrutinizing you the way you scrutinize yourself. The judgment you sense is often your own, externalized.

**"Once I feel safe, I'll relax."** Safety isn't a destination. The conditions you're waiting for will never be perfect enough. Learning to relax _while uncertain_ is the skill. Waiting for certainty is infinite waiting.

## The Body Keeps Score

Your anxiety doesn't just live in your head. It lives in your body.

Notice where you carry it. Jaw clenched? Shoulders at your ears? Shallow breathing? Stomach tight? These aren't random. Your nervous system is running constant threat detection.

Watch yourself enter a room. Scanning. Exits, power dynamics, who's aligned with whom, where the tension lives. Pattern recognition so automatic you forgot you were doing it.

The body-level tells of Six anxiety:

- **Eyes scanning** rather than settling
- **Tension in the gut** that never fully releases
- **Restless legs** or fidgeting when forced to sit still
- **Shallow, rapid breathing** during uncertainty
- **Physical flinch** at unexpected sounds or movements

This matters because anxiety reduction that ignores the body doesn't work. You can't think your way out of a physiological state.

### The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Protocol

When anxiety spikes, try this:

- **5** things you can see (name them aloud)
- **4** things you can physically feel (chair beneath you, feet on floor)
- **3** things you can hear (even subtle sounds)
- **2** things you can smell
- **1** thing you can taste

This isn't distraction. It's anchoring. Your fear lives in projected futures. Your body lives in the present. Pull attention into immediate sensory experience, and you give your nervous system evidence that _right now_, you're safe. The catastrophe is in your mind. Reality is here.

## Wings: How Your Neighbors Shape You

Your neighboring types add distinct flavors to your vigilance. Wing names describe the core strategy: the 6w5 "Defender" protects through knowledge and self-reliance; the 6w7 "Buddy" protects through connection and alliance-building.

### 6w5: The Defender

With a <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-5">Type 5 wing</a>, you become more independent and cerebral. Your security strategy emphasizes competence and knowledge. You might spend hours researching before making a decision, building expertise as a hedge against uncertainty.

6w5s gravitate toward technical fields, security research, investigative journalism. Anywhere that rewards meticulous preparation and healthy skepticism. Less socially anxious than other Sixes, more comfortable working alone, more likely to trust your own analysis over others' reassurance.

The shadow: isolation that cuts you off from support you actually need. Withdrawal disguised as self-sufficiency.

### 6w7: The Buddy

With a <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-7">Type 7 wing</a>, you balance anxiety with optimism and social energy. Your security strategy emphasizes connection and mobility. If this doesn't work out, there's always another option. Another group. Another adventure.

6w7s are often the social glue in groups. Organizing gatherings, checking in on people, using humor to defuse tension. More outwardly warm than other Sixes, more comfortable taking social risks, more likely to manage anxiety through activity and connection than withdrawal.

The shadow: scattered energy that never commits fully. Using busyness and socializing to avoid the fears you're running from.

</section>

<section class="section-content">

## Workplace Patterns

For Sixes, work is often the primary anxiety arena.

You need to know where you stand. Ambiguity about your performance, your standing, your job security? That's not just uncomfortable. It's threatening. A boss who doesn't give feedback leaves you filling blanks with worst-case interpretations.

### How It Shows Up

**With authority:** Leadership changes scramble your internal security map. Even good changes trigger recalibration anxiety. You study new bosses intensely: Are they competent? Do they follow through? Can they be trusted? Until you know, you're on guard.

**In teams:** You remember commitments others forgot. You notice when someone's effort is sliding. You ask "what about..." questions when everyone else is ready to move on. They call this negative. You're preventing the disaster they can't see coming.

**With decisions:** Big decisions can paralyze you. Not because you lack judgment. Because you see too many angles. You want more data, more opinions, more time. Sometimes this is wisdom. Sometimes it's fear wearing wisdom's mask.

**Career self-sabotage:** You stay in a role too long because it's familiar. Turn down promotions because they feel risky. Avoid visibility that could accelerate your career because it also increases scrutiny. The safe path feels wiser than it is.

</section>

<section class="section-content">

## Relationships: The Testing Ground

For you, relationships are laboratories where trust experiments play out daily.

You don't fall in love. You investigate it. You don't make friends. You test them. Every relationship becomes a series of small trials, whether you intend it that way or not.

### What Testing Actually Looks Like

You might not call it testing. But watch yourself:

- **The small crisis**: You mention something stressful and wait to see who checks in later. Those who remember earn trust points. Those who don't get filed away.

- **The scheduling test**: You suggest plans and note who follows through versus who flakes. Reliability in small things predicts reliability in big things.

- **The vulnerability probe**: You share something slightly risky and watch the reaction. Did they handle it with care? Did they weaponize it later? Data collected.

- **The opinion trap**: You express a view you're uncertain about and see if they agree too easily. Sycophants can't be trusted. You need people who'll tell you when you're wrong.

- **The withdrawal test**: You pull back slightly and observe who pursues. Who notices your absence? Who makes effort to reconnect?

You're not trying to be difficult. You're verifying who's actually safe.

The tragedy: you sometimes test relationships to destruction. Pushing and questioning until you create the abandonment you feared. The test was supposed to prove they'd stay. Instead, it drove them away.

### How You Love

You don't say "I love you" in grand gestures. You show it through vigilance and presence.

**You show up.** Not when it's convenient. When it matters. You remember the doctor's appointment they mentioned once. You check in after the hard conversation with their boss. You track the details of their life because you care about every one.

**You defend.** When someone criticizes the person you love, something protective rises. You might not say it publicly, but you won't let disrespect stand. Your loyalty has teeth.

**You stay.** When others would leave during illness, failure, scandal, hard seasons, you remain. Not because you're trapped. Because commitment isn't conditional for you.

**You prepare.** You think about their wellbeing constantly. Insurance, backup plans, what-if scenarios that protect them.

The tragedy: your love language (vigilance, preparation, loyalty) often reads as worry or control to people who don't understand. You're not controlling them. You're protecting them from every danger your mind can imagine.

### What You Need in Love

**Consistency over intensity.** A partner whose actions predictably match their words. In small things. Especially small things. You're watching.

**Patience with process.** Someone who understands trust is built through a thousand small proofs, not grand gestures. Someone who doesn't take your questioning personally.

**Calm in storms.** A presence that remains steady when your anxiety spikes. Neither dismissing your fears nor amplifying them by panicking with you.

### For Partners of Sixes

Their questioning isn't accusation. It's how they create safety. Their "what-ifs" aren't pessimism. They're mental preparation. Their need for reassurance isn't weakness. It's scar tissue from old betrayals.

**What builds trust:**

- Be boringly reliable. Show up when you say you will. Do what you promise. Small things matter more than grand gestures.
- Mean what you say. Sixes detect incongruence instantly. Don't say "I'm fine" when you're not.
- Stay calm when they're anxious. Your steadiness becomes their anchor. Panicking with them amplifies the spiral. Dismissing the fear makes them feel unseen.

**What erodes trust:**

- Dismissing their concerns as "paranoid" or "irrational." They've been right before.
- Springing surprises. What feels spontaneous to you feels destabilizing to them.
- Breaking small promises thinking they won't notice. They notice everything. Small betrayals seed large doubts.

**Signs they truly trust you:**

- They stop testing. The probes and questions decrease because they no longer need the data.
- They share fears openly. When a Six tells you what scares them without performing strength, you're in.
- They let you see them uncertain. A Six who admits "I don't know" to you has given you something precious.

Once a Six trusts you fully, they're with you through anything.

## The Path to Integration: From Fear to Faith

Your growth journey isn't about eliminating fear. That's not possible and wouldn't be desirable. It's about developing courage: right action despite fear.

You already know how to be afraid. The work is learning to move anyway.

### The Holy Idea: Faith

In Enneagram wisdom, each type has a "Holy Idea" that, when deeply understood, liberates the type from its core fixation. For Sixes, it's **Faith**.

Not religious faith. Something more fundamental: trust that the ground beneath you will hold. That things tend to work out. That you can handle what comes.

You've spent your life bracing for the earthquake. Faith is discovering you can stand on the earth without tensing for its collapse. Not because earthquakes don't happen, but because you've survived every one so far. Your survival rate is 100%.

This isn't naive optimism. It's evidence-based trust. You're still here. You navigated every crisis. Preparation helped, yes, but so did your inherent capacity to adapt. Faith is trusting that capacity.

### Moving Toward Nine

When you integrate, you move toward healthy <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-9">Type 9</a> patterns. Not passivity or conflict-avoidance. The capacity for:

**Inner calm.** A still center that remains stable regardless of external circumstances. The storm can rage outside. You can be steady within.

**Trust in process.** Accepting that not everything needs to be figured out in advance. Sometimes the way forward reveals itself only as you walk it.

**Present-moment awareness.** Releasing constant future-scanning to experience what's actually happening now. Most of what you fear never arrives. While you're fearing it, you miss what's real.

**Faith in self.** Discovering internal authority that doesn't require external validation. You've been asking everyone else if you can trust your own judgment. The answer has always been yes.

### What Healthy Sixes Actually Do

Integration isn't theoretical. Here's what it looks like:

- **Makes decisions without polling everyone.** The healthy Six consults their own judgment first. They might seek input, but it's data, not permission.

- **Tries new things without exhaustive research.** Not recklessly, but trusting they can figure it out as they go. The 47-page preparation isn't always necessary.

- **Lets small inconsistencies go.** Not everything is a red flag. Sometimes people are just having a bad day. Healthy Sixes distinguish warning signs from noise.

- **Trusts their read on situations.** That gut sense about people? Usually right. Integration means listening to it without needing external validation.

- **Speaks their mind without testing the waters.** Says what they think before calculating how it will land.

- **Embraces uncertainty as possibility.** Instead of "what could go wrong," they can also see "what could go right." The unknown contains gifts, not just threats.

### Practical Steps for Growth

**The Trust Practice**
Daily, take one small action without seeking reassurance. Order something without checking reviews. Make a decision without polling friends first. Notice that you survive. Build evidence that your judgment works.

**The Fear Inventory**
Write down what you're afraid of. Next to each fear: "What if I could handle this?" Not "this won't happen" but "what if I could navigate it if it did?" Shift from "prevent the worst" to "navigate whatever comes."

**The Body Check**
When anxiety rises, return to physical sensation. Where are your feet? What can you hear? Anchor in the present. Your fear lives in the future. Your body lives in now.

**The Courage Collection**
Keep a record of times you acted despite fear. Build evidence of your own bravery. You're more courageous than you give yourself credit for.

### The Ultimate Discovery

Here's the truth integrated Sixes discover: the security you've been seeking externally already exists within you.

You've been asking the world to prove it's safe. But safety was never about the world. It was about your capacity to navigate it. The preparation, the vigilance, the constant readiness aren't weaknesses. They're competencies you built.

When you trust your own inner authority, you stop seeking external validation for internal knowing. Not the false security of guarantees (those don't exist) but the real security of knowing _you can handle this_. Vigilance becomes wisdom. Questioning becomes discernment. Fear transforms into faith.

## Why You Might Be Mistyped

Sixes often test as other types, especially early in their Enneagram journey.

**Mistyped as Type 1:** Both types have strong inner critics and high standards. The difference: Ones focus on being right and good. Sixes focus on being safe and supported. If your critical voice is about moral correctness, you might be a 1. If it's about anticipating problems and threats, you're likely a 6.

**Mistyped as Type 9:** Both types can appear agreeable and conflict-avoidant. The difference: Nines merge to maintain internal peace. Sixes comply to maintain external support. Nines genuinely don't care about many things. Sixes care intensely but hide it. If your agreeableness is about keeping internal peace, you might be a 9. If it's about not losing allies, you're likely a 6.

**Mistyped as Type 8:** Counterphobic Sixes often look like 8s. Challenging authority, appearing fearless, confronting threats head-on. The difference: Eights feel inherently powerful. Counterphobic Sixes overcompensate for feeling inherently vulnerable. If you're aggressive because you genuinely don't feel fear, you might be an 8. If you're aggressive _because_ you feel fear and refuse to submit to it, you're likely a counterphobic 6.

**6 Anxiety vs. Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** Type 6 anxiety has a specific flavor. It centers on trust, loyalty, authority, and worst-case scenarios involving betrayal or abandonment. GAD is more free-floating, attaching to anything and everything. Sixes can also have GAD, but the Enneagram pattern points to relationship and trust-based fear, not generalized worry about health, finances, or random catastrophes.

## Sixes Speak

**On anxiety**: "It's not that I want to worry. NOT worrying feels irresponsible. Like I'm not doing my job of keeping everyone safe. If I stop scanning for danger, who will?"

**On loyalty**: "When I commit to you, I mean it at a cellular level. Betraying you would feel like betraying myself. I don't understand how people just walk away from things."

**On authority**: "I desperately want someone competent in charge. But the moment I spot incompetence, I can't unsee it. Then I'm back to square one, looking for someone else to trust."

**On growth**: "Learning to trust myself was like discovering I'd been carrying the map all along while frantically asking others for directions. I already knew the way. I just didn't trust that I knew."

`You seek reassurance before decisions—then question whether those people really know either.`,
`People praise your reliability, but they don't see how much energy it takes to be that dependable.`,
`You spot problems everyone else missed. Inconsistencies between words and actions set off alarm bells you can't ignore.`,
`Under stress, you shift into achievement mode, trying to become so competent you won't need anyone.`,
`Routines, systems, and clear guidelines make you feel safer. Ambiguity feels threatening.`,
`Your inner circle is small but fiercely trusted. Getting in is hard. Staying in is easy.`

## SECOND PASS REVIEW (Jan 2026)

### Completed Edits (Jan 29, 2026)

**Redundancies Fixed:**
✅ "100% survival rate" - Removed from Fear Inventory, kept in Holy Idea section where it lands better
✅ Counterphobic/8 mistyping - Removed from Phobic vs Counterphobic section, consolidated to Mistyping section
✅ Authority dynamics - Refocused Workplace section on leadership changes/recalibration, removed overlap with Authority Paradox

**Sections Trimmed:**
✅ "Voices from the Watchtower" intro paragraph - Removed filler, kept "In Their Own Words" heading
✅ Checklist - Trimmed from 12 to 9 items, consolidated overlapping items (reassurance, problem-spotting)

**Content Added:**
✅ Childhood section expanded - Added "Common Six Origin Patterns" with specific scenarios (unreliable protector, reversed roles, rule betrayal, sudden shift)
✅ "How You Love" section - Shows how Sixes express love positively (showing up, defending, staying, preparing)
✅ "For Partners of Sixes" expanded - Added what builds trust, what erodes trust, signs they truly trust you
✅ "The Holy Idea: Faith" section - Explained the spiritual/existential concept of Faith for Sixes
✅ "What Healthy Sixes Actually Do" - Concrete behavioral examples of integration
✅ Stress mechanism expanded - Added psychology explaining WHY Sixes go to 3 (vulnerability → self-sufficiency through achievement)
✅ "5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Protocol" - Specific body practice with explanation
✅ "What Sixes Get Wrong About Themselves" - Added after Projection section

**Minor Polish:**
✅ Wing section intro - Added explanation of naming convention (Defender = knowledge/self-reliance, Buddy = connection/alliance)
✅ FAQ schema - Added two new questions: "Why do Sixes make such loyal friends?" and "How can I tell if I'm a phobic or counterphobic Six?"

**Not Changed:**
- Article structure/order - Left as is; the current flow works well enough and reordering risks introducing new issues
- Ground metaphor at line 257 - Changed to "security map gets scrambled" instead

### Remaining Considerations for Future Passes
- Could add more about Six in leadership roles
- Consider adding a section on Six + specific relationship pairings
- Word count has increased; may need trimming if it feels too long
