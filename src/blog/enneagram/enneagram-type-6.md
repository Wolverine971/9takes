Highly committed to their relationships and communities, Type 6s value security, safety, and stability above all else.</p>

They are the vigilant guardians, always on the lookout for potential dangers or risks, which can make them appear apprehensive when they feel threatened.

Type 6s are characterized by their wariness about who to trust, yet they deeply seek a sense of belonging. This duality often leads them to form strong bonds with friends, family, and colleagues. The Loyalist's core emotion is fear, which drives their constant assessment of their environment for potential threats.
