<h2>😨 Fears of an Enneagram 7</h2>

One of the core fears of Type 7s is the fear of being trapped or limited in their options and experiences. They have a natural desire for freedom, adventure, and exploration, and they may fear that commitments or responsibilities will limit their ability to pursue these things. As a result, they may avoid situations that feel constricting or confining, and they may struggle with commitment in relationships, careers, or other areas of their life.

Another fear of Type 7s is the fear of missing out on experiences or opportunities. They have a strong FOMO (fear of missing out) drive, and they may feel anxious or restless when they perceive that there are experiences or opportunities available to them that they are not able to access. This can sometimes lead to impulsive decision-making or a tendency to jump from one experience to another without fully considering the consequences.

Finally, Type 7s may also fear experiencing difficult or painful emotions. They may have a tendency to avoid or suppress negative feelings, preferring to focus on positive experiences and emotions. This can sometimes lead to a lack of emotional depth or intimacy in their relationships, as well as a tendency to avoid dealing with important issues or conflicts.
