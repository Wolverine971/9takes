<h2>🧭 Motivations of an Enneagram 7</h2>

Type 7s are motivated by the desire for new experiences and adventure. They want to feel alive and engaged with the world around them.

<h2>😨 Fears of an Enneagram 7</h2>

One of the core fears of Type 7s is the fear of being trapped or limited in their options and experiences. They naturally desire freedom, adventure, and exploration and may fear that commitments or responsibilities will restrict their ability to pursue these things. As a result, they may avoid situations that feel constricting or confining and struggle with commitment in relationships, careers, or other areas of their life.

Another fear of Type 7s is missing out on experiences or opportunities. They have an intense FOMO (fear of missing out) drive, and they may feel anxious or restless when they perceive that there are experiences or opportunities available to them that they cannot access. This can sometimes lead to impulsive decision-making or jumping from one adventure to another without fully considering the consequences.

Finally, Type 7s may also fear experiencing difficult or painful emotions. They may avoid or suppress negative feelings, preferring to focus on positive experiences and emotions. This can sometimes lead to a lack of emotional depth or intimacy in their relationships and a tendency to avoid dealing with critical issues or conflicts.
