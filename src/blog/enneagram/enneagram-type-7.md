<h2>Motivations</h2>

Type 7s are motivated by the desire for new experiences and adventure. They want to feel alive and engaged with the world around them. They have a fear of missing out and can struggle with feeling trapped or limited in any way. They want to be free to explore and create, and can feel restless or unhappy when they are stuck in routine or monotony.

<article class="section-content">

<h2>Fears</h2>

One of the core fears of Type 7s is the fear of being trapped or limited in their options and experiences. They have a natural desire for freedom, adventure, and exploration, and they may fear that commitments or responsibilities will limit their ability to pursue these things. As a result, they may avoid situations that feel constricting or confining, and they may struggle with commitment in relationships, careers, or other areas of their life.

Another fear of Type 7s is the fear of missing out on experiences or opportunities. They have a strong FOMO (fear of missing out) drive, and they may feel anxious or restless when they perceive that there are experiences or opportunities available to them that they are not able to access. This can sometimes lead to impulsive decision-making or a tendency to jump from one experience to another without fully considering the consequences.

Finally, Type 7s may also fear experiencing difficult or painful emotions. They may have a tendency to avoid or suppress negative feelings, preferring to focus on positive experiences and emotions. This can sometimes lead to a lack of emotional depth or intimacy in their relationships, as well as a tendency to avoid dealing with important issues or conflicts.

<h2>In Relationships</h2>

In relationships, Type 7s can be fun-loving, adventurous, and passionate partners. They often have a natural charm and enthusiasm that can be very attractive to others. They enjoy trying new things and exploring the world together with their partner.

However, Type 7s can also struggle with staying committed to long-term relationships. They may become restless or bored if the relationship becomes too routine or predictable.

To help Type 7s thrive in relationships, it is important for them to have a partner who shares their sense of adventure and is willing to explore new things with them. It is also helpful for their partner to be patient and understanding when they become restless or distracted. It can be helpful for Type 7s to learn to embrace difficult emotions and work on developing deeper connections with their partner, rather than just seeking out new experiences.
