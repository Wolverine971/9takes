<h2 id="motivations">🧭 Motivations of an Enneagram 7</h2>

Type 7s are primarily motivated by a desire to experience joy, excitement, and fulfillment in their lives.

"The Enthusiast" is driven by a fear of missing out on worthwhile experiences and a constant pursuit of stimulation and novelty. They seek to avoid feelings of boredom, pain, or limitation by continuously exploring new ideas, activities, and adventures. This motivation stems from an underlying belief that life should be enjoyed to the fullest and that happiness can be found through the acquisition of diverse experiences and knowledge. Type 7s are also motivated by a need to maintain a sense of freedom and autonomy, as they fear being trapped or constrained by mundane responsibilities or negative emotions.

</section>

<section class="section-content">

<h2 id="fears">😨 Fears of an Enneagram 7</h2>

One of the core fears of Type 7s is the fear of being trapped or limited in their options and experiences.

They naturally desire freedom, adventure, and exploration and may fear that commitments or responsibilities will restrict their ability to pursue these things. As a result, they may avoid situations that feel constricting or confining and struggle with commitment in relationships, careers, or other areas of their life.

Another fear of Type 7s is missing out on experiences or opportunities. They have an intense FOMO (fear of missing out) drive, and they may feel anxious or restless when they perceive that there are experiences or opportunities available to them that they cannot access. This can sometimes lead to impulsive decision-making or jumping from one adventure to another without fully considering the consequences.

Finally, Type 7s may also fear experiencing difficult or painful emotions. They may avoid or suppress negative feelings, preferring to focus on positive experiences and emotions. This can sometimes lead to a lack of emotional depth or intimacy in their relationships and a tendency to avoid dealing with critical issues or conflicts.

<h2 id="stress">🤯 Enneagram 7s Under Stress</h2>

Under stress, the usually spontaneous and fun-loving Type 7 may become uncharacteristically rigid, critical, and perfectionistic.

Their stress number is Type 1. <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-1">Type 1s</a> are normally principled, ethical, and perfectionistic. When they're under stress, they might become more critical and judgmental of themselves and others and rigid and inflexible in their thinking.

They may feel a strong need to control their environment and the people around them, driven by a fear of things spiraling out of control. The stressed Type 7 might become overly serious and judgmental, setting unrealistically high standards for themselves and others. They may also become more self-critical, focusing on their own perceived shortcomings and failures, which can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and resentment.
