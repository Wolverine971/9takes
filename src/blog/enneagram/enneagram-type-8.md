<p class="firstLetter">Type 8s, are known as "The Challengers."</p>

They embody assertiveness and self-confidence but they need control.

Their directness and tendency to control situations can be perceived as domineering, but this is their go-to coping mechanism (and it has served them well since childhood). At some point in an 8's childhood, they learned to not be weak or put themselves in a vulnerable situation.

Therefore their chosen life strategy is to continually get stronger and gain power in all aspects of life so that they never have to be vulnerable again.

<h2 id="motivations">🧭 Motivations of an Enneagram 8</h2>

Type 8 individuals are driven by a need for control or having the most freedom possible.

They also have a desire to protect themselves and those they care about. Many 8s can point to a time in their childhood when they felt vulnerable and were taken advantage of. So the 8s are highly motivated to never let that happen again. They pursue ever higher and higher levels of freedom. 8s want to be so strong that they never rely on others for support. They value their independence and will do almost anything to avoid being in a vulnerable situation again.

<h2 id="fears">😨 Fears of an Enneagram 8</h2>

The primary fear of Enneagram Type 8 individuals is the fear of being controlled or manipulated by others.

They may feel threatened by anyone or anything that could limit their freedom or power. This fear can sometimes manifest as a need for control and a tendency to dominate others to maintain their autonomy. Enneagram Type 8 individuals may also fear vulnerability, as they perceive vulnerability as a potential weakness that others could exploit.

This looks like an 8 working out really hard so that someone cannot physically overpower them. This looks like an 8 working long hours so that they can remain financially independent. This looks like an 8 sitting in a restaurant facing the door and reading the body language of everyone who enters the room. This looks like an 8 being a minimalist, so they aren't weighed down by excess possessions and can "move fast" unincumbered.

<h2 id="stress">🤯 Enneagram 8s Under Stress</h2>

Under duress, the normally assertive and action-oriented Type 8 may become uncharacteristically withdrawn, isolated, and detached.

A type 8's stress number is 5. <a href="/blog/enneagram/enneagram-type-5">Type 5s</a> are analytical, independent, and private. When an 8 is stressed, they become more withdrawn and self-isolated from others. They may become cold and distant in their relationships. They might also struggle to say exactly what they feel, fearing their vulnerability not being well received.

They may retreat into a world of intellectualization and analysis, becoming excessively preoccupied with their thoughts and ideas as a means of coping with stress. The stressed Type 8 might become more secretive and withholding, hoarding information and resources as a way to maintain a sense of control and power. They may also become more cynical and mistrustful, viewing others as potential threats to their autonomy and independence.

<h2 id="relationships">👫 An Enneagram 8 in relationships</h2>

Enneagram Type 8 individuals can be complex partners in relationships.

On one hand, they are fiercely loyal and protective of those they care about and can be generous and supportive. But they can also be dominant and controlling in their relationships.

Type 8s prefer direct communication in their relationships, which can be refreshing for some partners but be off-putting for others. They may struggle to compromise with their partners, leading to conflicts and power struggles. They have a tendency to avoid vulnerability can make it difficult for them to connect emotionally with their partners. Many 8 partners want the 8 to express their feelings and show more empathy.

However, for context, the Enneagram 8 partner may be one of the only people that the 8 has actually been vulnerable with.

<h3>Tips for an Enneagram type 8 in a relationship</h3>

To have a successful relationship with an Enneagram Type 8, it is essential to communicate openly and honestly.

8s need their need for independence and autonomy and their partners need to know that. It can be helpful to establish clear boundaries and expectations early on in the relationship and talk about what compromise will look like. It also may be helpful for Enneagram Type 8 individuals to be vulnerable early on so that later, when conflict does arise, being vulnerable will feel foreign. An 8s partner should try to gently coax out the softness in the 8.

If an Enneagram 8's partner can get at the 8's soft underbelly, it will be an excellent place for cuddles and warm feelings to come out.

<h2 id="workplace">💼 An Enneagram 8 in the Workplace</h2>

Type 8s can be powerful and influential leaders in the workplace.

They are natural problem solvers with a talent for identifying and addressing challenges head-on. They are also highly independent, self-assured, and unafraid to take risks or make tough decisions.

This will help later when it comes time to collaborate and compromise. Additionally, it may be essential to provide Type 8 with opportunities to take on leadership roles and give them the freedom to exercise their problem-solving skills.

<h2 id="experience">🤝 Enneagram eight's sharing their experience</h2>

In this Enneagram panel discussion, moderator Beatrice Chestnut welcomes a group of Enneagram type 8s to share their personal experiences and insights about this body-based personality type. The panelists include Suzanna, Jeanette, Connie, and Don, all of whom have studied the Enneagram in-depth and reflect on how the 8 archetype manifests in their lives.

Key takeaways from the video include:

- 8s often describe having an early experience of needing to be stronger or more powerful than their actual age or size as a child, leading to a sense of inner intensity and a desire to take action.
- 8s can come across as intimidating or aggressive, but this is often not their intention - they simply have a bold, direct communication style rooted in a concern for truth and justice.
- Underlying the 8's tough exterior is a vulnerability and sensitivity that they can struggle to fully express, sometimes resorting to overcontrol or impulsiveness as a result.
