<p class="firstLetter">Type 8s, are known as "The Challengers." They embody assertiveness and self-confidence and need control. Their directness and tendency to control situations can be perceived as domineering, but this is their go-to coping mechanism that has served them well since childhood. Sometime in their childhood, they learned that being weak or putting yourself in vulnerable situations is not okay. So their way of being is to continually get stronger in all aspects of life so that they can control their own destiny. </p>

<h2>😨 Fears of an Enneagram 8</h2>

The primary fear of Enneagram Type 8 individuals is the fear of being controlled or manipulated by others. They may feel threatened by anyone or anything that could limit their freedom or power. This fear can sometimes manifest as a need for control and a tendency to dominate others to maintain their autonomy. Enneagram Type 8 individuals may also fear vulnerability, as they perceive vulnerability as a potential weakness that others could exploit.

This looks like an 8 working out really hard so that someone cannot physically overpower them. This looks like an 8 working long hours so that they can remain financially independent. This looks like an 8 sitting in a restaurant facing the door and reading the body language of everyone who enters the room. This looks like an 8 being a minimalist, so they aren't weighed down by excess possessions and can "move fast" unincumbered.

<h2>👫 An Enneagram 8 in relationships</h2>

Enneagram Type 8 individuals can be complex partners in relationships. On one hand, they are fiercely loyal and protective of those they care about and can be generous and supportive. They are also direct in their communication, which can be refreshing for some partners but be off-putting for others.

Type 8 individuals can also be dominant and controlling in their relationships. They may struggle to compromise with their partners, leading to conflicts and power struggles. Additionally, their tendency to avoid vulnerability can make it difficult for them to connect emotionally with their partners or express their feelings in a supportive and nurturing way. Their partner may be one of the few people that the 8 can actually be vulnerable with.

To have a successful relationship with an Enneagram Type 8, it is essential to communicate openly and honestly while respecting their need for independence and autonomy. It can be helpful to establish clear boundaries and expectations early on in the relationship and talk about what compromise will look like. It also may be helpful for Enneagram Type 8 individuals to be vulnerable early on so that later, when conflict does arise, being vulnerable will feel foreign. An 8s partner should try to gently coax out the softness in the 8. If they can get at the 8's soft underbelly, it will be an excellent place for cuddles and whooshy boosting.
