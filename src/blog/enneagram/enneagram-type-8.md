<h2>ðŸ‘« An Enneagram 8 in relationships</h2>

Enneagram Type 8 individuals can be complex partners in relationships. On one hand, they are fiercely loyal and protective of those they care about and can be generous and supportive. They are also direct in their communication, which can be refreshing for some partners but be off putting for others.

Type 8 individuals can also be dominant and controlling in their relationships. They may struggle to compromise with their partners, leading to conflicts and power struggles. Additionally, their tendency to avoid vulnerability can make it difficult for them to connect emotionally with their partners or express their feelings in a supportive and nurturing way. Or their partner may be one of the few people that the 8 actually can be vulnerable with.

To have a successful relationship with an Enneagram Type 8, it is essential to communicate openly and honestly while respecting their need for independence and autonomy. It can be helpful to establish clear boundaries and expectations early on in the relationship and talk about what compromise will look like. It also may be helpful for Enneagram Type 8 individuals to be vulnerable early on so that later when conflict does arise being vulnerable wont feel so foreign. An 8s partner should try to gently coax out the softness in the 8. If they are able to get at the 8s soft underbelly it will serve as the great place for cuddles and hooshy booshin.
