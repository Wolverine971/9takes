<h2 id="childhood">🧸 An Enneagram 9's Childhood</h2>

The childhood experiences of Enneagram Type 9 individuals play a significant role in shaping their personality and worldview:

- **Childhood Stereotype:** Type 9s often grew up in environments where they felt their presence was overlooked or that they needed to maintain peace and harmony at all costs.

- **Childhood Wound:** Many Type 9s felt neglected or that their opinions and presence didn't matter, leading to a tendency to blend in or go along with others. They developed a coping mechanism of minimizing their own desires and prioritizing the peace and comfort of those around them.

- **Developmental Aspects:**

  - May have been surrounded by strong personalities or conflict, leading them to take on a mediating role from a young age.
  - Often found comfort in routine, familiar environments, and activities that didn't draw attention to themselves.
  - Might have learned that expressing strong opinions or emotions led to discomfort or conflict, reinforcing their tendency to withdraw.

- **Typical Behaviors:** As children, Type 9s often avoided conflict, appeared complacent or agreeable, and developed a chameleon-like ability to blend into different social groups.

- **Thoughts and Feelings:** Developed a deep desire for inner and outer peace, often at the cost of neglecting their own needs and aspirations. May have felt invisible or unimportant within their family dynamic.

- **View on Childhood:** Looking back, many Type 9s reflect on their childhood as a period of relative comfort but also recognize a pattern of self-neglect and a struggle to assert their own identity and desires.

Understanding these childhood dynamics can provide valuable insights for Type 9s in their journey of self-discovery and personal growth. It can help them recognize the roots of their conflict avoidance, their tendency to merge with others, and their challenges with self-assertion.
