<h2>😨 Fears of an Enneagram 9</h2>

Enneagram Type 9 individuals have a core fear of loss and separation. They are terrified of being disconnected from others and losing the sense of peace and harmony they strive to maintain. This fear can manifest in different ways, such as avoiding conflict to keep the peace, minimizing their needs to keep others happy, or merging with others to avoid feeling separate or alone.

Enneagram Type 9 individuals may also fear their anger and assertiveness. They may have learned early in life that expressing these emotions can cause conflict and disrupt the peace they crave, so they may suppress these feelings and avoid situations that trigger them. This can lead to a sense of inner turmoil and a feeling of being stuck or trapped in their own lives.

Additionally, Enneagram Type 9 individuals may fear making the wrong decision or taking action that could lead to conflict or loss. They may struggle with making choices and taking risks because they fear the consequences of making mistakes or upsetting others.
