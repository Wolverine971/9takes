## Quick Answer

**How can you spot someone's Enneagram type at a party?** Each type has a predictable social pattern. Type 1s organize the kitchen while judging, Type 2s make sure everyone's okay, Type 3s network with successful people, Type 4s have intense corner conversations, Type 5s observe and plan their escape, Type 6s check on friends' safety, Type 7s plan the after-party mid-party, Type 8s dominate the energy, Type 9s merge with whatever group they're in. Watch their location, drink choice, and what they're secretly thinking—it reveals everything.

**Read time**: 8 minutes | **Party trick**: Type anyone in under 10 minutes

**Parties are personality laboratories.**

No scripts. No meetings. No agendas. Just humans being human under social pressure.

And here's what nobody tells you: **Everyone's playing a different game.**

The person organizing the playlist? Different game than the one in the kitchen.
The networker working the room? Different game than the philosopher in the corner.
The life of the party? Different game than the one who already left.

**Nine games. Nine strategies. Nine types.**

Which one are you playing?

## The After-Party Analysis

**Plot twist:** Everyone's playing their childhood survival strategy in party clothes.

The perfectionist organizing? **Earning love through being good.**  
The helper caring for everyone? **Earning love through being needed.**  
The achiever networking? **Earning love through success.**

Nine different games. Nine different wounds. One party.

**The real question isn't "What's your party style?"**

It's "What game are you tired of playing?"

### Your Party Prescription

- **Type 1:** Let something be imperfect tonight
- **Type 2:** Receive help without reciprocating
- **Type 3:** Have fun without documenting it
- **Type 4:** Enjoy something ordinary
- **Type 5:** Stay 30 minutes longer than comfortable
- **Type 6:** Trust one stranger
- **Type 7:** Have one deep conversation
- **Type 8:** Show one vulnerability
- **Type 9:** Voice one strong opinion

**Break your pattern. Change your party. Change your life.**
