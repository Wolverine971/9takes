<p class="firstLetter">Modern relationships are tough.</p>

After school is done and work is over for the day, it can be hard to find friends and meet new people. And when you do meet someone how long does it take before you can open up to them? And what if they ghost you? These are real concerns and people becoming increasingly risk averse. Though ghosting is a **"first world problem"** its becoming more and more of an issue.

Today we are going to look at the impact of ghosting on different Enneagram types.

It's important to recognize that not everyone responds the same way to ghosting and our response is shaped by our personalities and perspectives. Below we'll uncover the influence of ghosting on mental health through the lens of the [personality system called the Enneagram](/blog/enneagram/beginners-guide-to-determining-your-enneagram-type). We'll go into how each Enneagram type experiences and copes with the unsettling aftermath of ghosting, and offer strategies for healing and growth.

 <section class="section-content">
  <h3 style="padding: 0; margin-top: 1em">Type One: The Perfectionist</h3>
   Type Ones, known for their strong sense of morality and desire for improvement, may struggle
   with feelings of betrayal and disappointment when ghosted. They may also feel a sense of
   personal failure, believing that they could have done something differently to prevent the
   ghosting from happening. To cope with these feelings, Ones may benefit from taking a step back
   and looking at the situation objectively. They may also want to focus on self-compassion and
   self-care, reminding themselves that they are not to blame for the other person's actions.

It's important to acknowledge that everyone's experience with ghosting is unique, and the Enneagram is just one tool to understand it. Being ghosted can be painful, so if you're currently experiencing it, take a moment to check in with yourself. If it's affecting your mental health, reach out to a close friend or seek professional help and support. Remember, healing and moving forward are possible with time and self-compassion.

In conclusion, ghosting affects individuals differently, and understanding how each Enneagram type copes with it can foster empathy. Healing and moving forward are achievable through self-compassion and care.
