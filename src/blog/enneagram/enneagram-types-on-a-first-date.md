<p class="firstLetter">Everyone gets a little nervous before a first date.</p>

There is so much to think about and plan for and there are so many ways for the date to go sideways. In this blog, we explore each Enneagram type's mindset going into a first date. We examine how each type prepares, what they likely feel, and their unique preferences when it comes to red and green flags.

**There is no foolproof dating guide, but if there was one it would mention the ideas in this blog.** It's a lens to better understand and empathize with your date - or even yourself. Dive in, and let's decode the dating dance, starting with Type 1, The Perfectionist...

<section class="section-content">
<h2 style="padding: 0; margin-top: 1em">Enneagram Type 1: The Perfectionist</h2>

The Perfectionist, with their strong desire for order and rightness, will approach a first date with carefully laid plans.

They approach their first date with clear expectations, perhaps even an ideal image of how it should go. They're likely to spend much time choosing the perfect location, focusing on making the best impression possible. They might feel excitement and nervousness stemming from their fear of making a mistake or being imperfect. However, their genuine desire to do things right usually wins over anxious feelings.

Their preparation often includes thorough grooming, rehearsing conversation topics, and planning contingencies. They are careful with their appearance, striving to look presentable but not overly flashy. Their conversation topics might lean towards societal issues, morals, or personal achievements, as they love sharing their vision of a better world.

### Red Flags for Type 1

If a Perfectionist hears phrases like "I usually wing it" or "I don't care about rules," it can be a significant warning sign, implying a lack of organization and discipline. Type 1s value responsibility and might perceive such an attitude as careless.

### Good Signals for Type 1

On the other hand, statements like "I appreciate your attention to detail" or "I also strive to improve" can be heartening. These show respect for their principles and an alignment with their constant drive for self-improvement.

<h2 style="padding: 0; margin-top: 1em">Enneagram Type 2: The Helper</h2>

The Helper, known for their warm-hearted nature, gears up for a first date with empathy and connection in mind.

They are often in tune with others' needs and think extensively about making their date feel comfortable and appreciated. They might feel a rush of enthusiasm and perhaps a hint of worry about being liked back, but their optimistic outlook usually dominates any fear.

The Helper's preparations might involve personal touches, like a small, thoughtful gift or choosing a location their date will surely enjoy. Their conversation may center on their date, showcasing their listening skills and genuine interest. From discussing their date's favorite hobbies to their loved ones, Type 2's approach fosters a warm, inviting atmosphere.

### Red Flags for Type 2

Phrases that suggest selfishness or lack of empathy, like "I don't care what others think," can alarm a Type 2. They value interpersonal relationships and a considerate nature.

### Good Signals for Type 2

Comments such as "Your kindness is touching" or "I love helping others too" indicate understanding and appreciation for the Helper's caring nature, which they would find reassuring.

<h2 style="padding: 0; margin-top: 1em">Enneagram Type 3: The Achiever</h2>

The Achiever is goal-oriented and thrives on accomplishment. A first date, to them, is another exciting challenge. Their thoughts center around presenting their best self, showcasing their achievements and ambitions without overwhelming their date. They might feel the thrill of competition and perhaps anxiety about being impressive enough.

In preparation, they likely ensure they're well-groomed, dressed sharply, and arrive punctually. They might plan to steer conversations towards their achievements subtly, their passion projects, or future ambitions. However, they're also careful to engage with their date's interests and accomplishments, recognizing the importance of mutual respect in the budding relationship.

### Red Flags for Type 3

Hearing "Why bother trying so hard?" can be disheartening for the Achiever, as it undermines their ambitious nature. Type 3s are focused on their goals and can perceive such an attitude as complacency.

### Good Signals for Type 3

However, phrases like "Your drive is inspiring" or "I admire your achievements" can be encouraging. It shows an appreciation for their hard work and ambition.

Hearing "Why can't you be more like others?" can significantly deter Type 4s. They value their uniqueness, and any attempt to box them into societal norms can be off-putting.

### Good Signals for Type 4

On the positive side, remarks such as "I admire your creativity" or "Your unique perspective is fascinating" can deeply resonate with them. These affirmations validate their individuality and emotional depth.

The Investigator, stereotypically introverted and known for analytical mind, is likely nervous but has thoughtfully considered every aspect of the date.

Their thoughts likely involve understanding their date's character, potential compatibility, and what exciting insights they might share. Their feelings might be a mix of curiosity and some apprehension, given their natural desire for privacy.
