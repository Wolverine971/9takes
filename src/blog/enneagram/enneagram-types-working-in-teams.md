<p class="firstLetter">Some teams are crushing it. Others are slow-moving disasters where every meeting feels like a hostage situation.</p>

What's the difference? It's not just skills or work ethic. It's how people think, what they fear, and what they need to feel safe enough to do their best work. The Enneagram maps these patterns. Once you see them, you can't unsee them.

Here's how each [Enneagram type](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-tldr) shows up in teams, what drives them crazy, and how to actually work with them instead of just tolerating them.

## How Each Enneagram Type Works in a Team

Each type brings something essential. Each type has blind spots that can derail collaboration. Here's the breakdown: what they want, how they show up in different roles, what to never do with them, and how to give feedback that actually lands.

<section class="section-content">

### Enneagram Type 1: The Perfectionist Who Keeps Standards High

Principled, responsible, and improvement-oriented. Type 1s have a strong sense of right and wrong and strive to maintain high standards. Self-disciplined, reliable, and focused on doing things correctly.

#### What they bring to a team

Quality control. The Perfectionist ensures the team follows processes and maintains standards. They'll catch what others miss and push for excellence when the team is tempted to cut corners.

#### As a boss

Detail-oriented and demanding. Provides clear instructions and expects them followed precisely. Leads by example. Struggles to delegate because they believe they can do it better. Will critique work that doesn't meet their standards. Don't take it personally. They do this to themselves too.

#### As a peer

Reliable and diligent. Goes above and beyond. May critique your work if it doesn't meet their standards. This comes from wanting the best outcome, not personal attack.

#### As a subordinate

Follows processes meticulously. Expects clear direction. Gets frustrated when leadership seems inconsistent or when standards slip.

#### What NOT to do with a Type 1

- Don't dismiss their concerns about quality as "nitpicking"
- Don't cut corners and expect them to cover for you
- Don't make excuses. They respect accountability.
- Don't take their criticism personally. They're harder on themselves.
- Don't spring last-minute changes on them

#### Giving feedback

Be objective and specific. Focus on the work, not the person. "This section needs X" lands better than "You missed the mark." Acknowledge their dedication, then provide concrete improvement suggestions.

### Enneagram Type 2: The Helper Who Keeps Teams Connected

Caring, generous, and people-oriented. Type 2s have a strong desire to be appreciated. Empathetic, supportive, and always ready to lend a hand. Sometimes before you even ask.

#### What they bring to a team

Relationship glue. The Helper keeps the team connected, remembers birthdays, notices when someone's struggling, and makes sure no one feels left out. They're the team's emotional barometer.

#### As a boss

Supportive and nurturing. Creates positive, collaborative environments. May struggle with tough decisions or critical feedback because they fear being disliked. Watch for over-investing in team morale at the expense of accountability.

#### As a peer

Friendly, attuned to emotions, will take on extra work to lighten your load. Goes out of their way to make you feel valued. May put others' needs ahead of their own deadlines.

#### As a subordinate

Eager to help, quick to volunteer. Struggles with boundaries and saying no. May overcommit and burn out.

#### What NOT to do with a Type 2

- Don't take their help for granted without acknowledgment
- Don't give them all the "people work" and none of the visible projects
- Don't exploit their inability to say no
- Don't be cold or transactional. They need warmth.
- Don't assume they're fine just because they're always asking how _you_ are

#### Giving feedback

Acknowledge their contributions first. They need to feel appreciated. Then be gentle but clear about boundaries: "Your support is valuable, AND your own deliverables matter too." Reassure them that setting limits won't make them less valued.

## When Types Clash (and When They Click)

Understanding individual types is step one. Step two is seeing how they interact.

**High-friction pairs to watch:**

- **1 + 7**: The Perfectionist wants to get it right. The Enthusiast wants to move on to the next thing. One pushes for polish while the other pushes for pace.
- **4 + 8**: The Individualist needs emotional acknowledgment. The Challenger just wants action. One feels steamrolled. The other feels slowed down.
- **5 + 2**: The Investigator needs space to think. The Helper needs connection. One feels smothered. The other feels shut out.
- **3 + 9**: The Achiever drives hard. The Peacemaker absorbs without pushing back. One burns out. The other gets invisible.

**Natural synergies:**

- **1 + 6**: Both value doing things right and being prepared. Solid foundation for reliable execution.
- **3 + 8**: Both drive toward results. High-energy execution when aligned on goals.
- **2 + 9**: Both prioritize harmony and support. Create a collaborative, low-conflict environment.
- **5 + 1**: Both value competence and getting things right. Deep analysis meets principled standards.

The key isn't avoiding conflict. It's understanding the pattern so you can navigate it.

For the full breakdown of all 81 type combinations, see [Enneagram Compatibility Matrix](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-compatibility-matrix) and [Enneagram Team Dynamics](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-team-dynamics).

## The Bottom Line

Teams fail when people assume everyone thinks like they do. Teams succeed when they decode the patterns.

The Type 1's criticism? About quality, not you personally. The Type 5's silence? Processing, not disengagement. The Type 8's directness? Energy, not attack.

**Three things to do this week:**

1. **Identify the types on your current team.** Start with yourself.
2. **Notice your friction points.** Which types trigger you? That's where the growth is.
3. **Adjust one conversation.** Pick one colleague, try one small shift based on their type.

The Enneagram doesn't excuse behavior. It explains it. Which means you can work with it instead of against it.
