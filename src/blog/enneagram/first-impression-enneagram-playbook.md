<p class="firstLetter">They've already decided about you.</p>

**10 seconds.** That's all it took.

Before you opened your mouth. Before your elevator pitch. Before your charming story.

Their Enneagram type determined exactly what they were looking forâ€”and whether you delivered it.

- Type 8s dismissed you for weak energy
- Type 5s wrote you off for surface-level chatter
- Type 2s felt your emotional coldness
- Type 1s noticed you were 3 minutes late

You're not failing at first impressions. **You're using the wrong playbook for their personality.**

## Type 1 - The Perfectionist: They're Grading You Already

### The 10-Second Test You Don't Know You're Taking

**Body language tells:**

- Scanning your appearance for effort
- Checking time obsessively

- They physically tense at inefficiency
- They arrived 10 minutes early

### The Hidden Psychology

**What they're really thinking:** _"Can I respect this person's standards?"_

Their inner critic runs 24/7. If you pass their initial quality check, they relax into actual human connection.

### Your 60-Second Playbook

**Opening move:** Arrive early. Firm handshake. One specific compliment about something they've clearly put effort into.

**Power questions that hook Type 1s:**

- "What's something you've improved recently that most people wouldn't notice?"
- "How do you maintain such high standards without burning out?"
- "What's your take on [topic]? You seem like someone who's thought this through."

**Body language that works:**

- Upright posture (mirror theirs)

## Your First Impression Cheat Sheet

### The 10-Second Read

**Look for these instant tells:**

1. **Energy level** - High (3,7,8) vs Low (4,5,9) vs Controlled (1,2,6)
2. **Eye contact** - Intense (4,8) vs Minimal (5,9) vs Searching (1,2,3,6,7)
3. **Physical space** - Invading (2,8) vs Protecting (5,6) vs Neutral (1,3,4,7,9)
4. **Speaking style** - Rapid (3,7) vs Measured (1,5) vs Responsive (2,6,9) vs Intense (4,8)

### The Universal First Impression Hack

**When in doubt:**

1. Mirror their energy level
2. Respect their space preferences
3. Match their emotional temperature
4. Ask about what lights them up

## The Science Behind Instant Connection

**MIT research shows:** We make 11 major decisions about someone in the first 7 seconds.

**What the Enneagram reveals:** Those decisions are filtered through our type's core fear and desire.

- Type 1s scan for: Competence
- Type 2s scan for: Warmth
- Type 3s scan for: Success
- Type 4s scan for: Depth
- Type 5s scan for: Intelligence
- Type 6s scan for: Safety
- Type 7s scan for: Fun
- Type 8s scan for: Strength
- Type 9s scan for: Peace

**Give them what they're scanning for, and the door opens.**

## Your Action Plan

1. **This week:** Identify three people's types using the tells above
2. **Test it:** Use their type's playbook in your next interaction
3. **Notice:** How the conversation shifts when you speak their language
4. **Advanced move:** Share this with someone and guess each other's types

The person across from you isn't mysterious.

They're predictableâ€”once you know their type.

Stop using generic approaches. Start speaking their emotional language.

**First impressions aren't about being liked. They're about being understood.**
