<p class="firstLetter">They've already decided about you.</p>

**10 seconds.** That's all it took.

Before you opened your mouth. Before your elevator pitch. Before your charming story.

Their Enneagram type determined exactly what they were looking for—and whether you delivered it.

- Type 8s dismissed you for weak energy
- Type 5s wrote you off for surface-level chatter
- Type 2s felt your emotional coldness
- Type 1s noticed you were 3 minutes late

You're not failing at first impressions. **You're using the wrong playbook for their personality.**

**Power questions that hook Type 1s:**

## Your First Impression Cheat Sheet

### The 10-Second Read

**Look for these instant tells:**

1. **Energy level** - High (3,7,8) vs Low (4,5,9) vs Controlled (1,2,6)
2. **Eye contact** - Intense (4,8) vs Minimal (5,9) vs Searching (1,2,3,6,7)
3. **Physical space** - Invading (2,8) vs Protecting (5,6) vs Neutral (1,3,4,7,9)
4. **Speaking style** - Rapid (3,7) vs Measured (1,5) vs Responsive (2,6,9) vs Intense (4,8)

### The Universal First Impression Hack

**When in doubt:**

1. Mirror their energy level
2. Respect their space preferences
3. Match their emotional temperature
4. Ask about what lights them up

## The Science Behind Instant Connection

**MIT research shows:** We make 11 major decisions about someone in the first 7 seconds.

**What the Enneagram reveals:** Those decisions are filtered through our type's core fear and desire.

- Type 1s scan for: Competence
- Type 2s scan for: Warmth
- Type 3s scan for: Success
- Type 4s scan for: Depth
- Type 5s scan for: Intelligence
- Type 6s scan for: Safety
- Type 7s scan for: Fun
- Type 8s scan for: Strength
- Type 9s scan for: Peace

**Give them what they're scanning for, and the door opens.**

## Your Action Plan

1. **This week:** Identify three people's types using the tells above
2. **Test it:** Use their type's playbook in your next interaction
3. **Notice:** How the conversation shifts when you speak their language
4. **Advanced move:** Share this with someone and guess each other's types

The person across from you isn't mysterious.

They're predictable—once you know their type.

Stop using generic approaches. Start speaking their emotional language.

**First impressions aren't about being liked. They're about being understood.**
