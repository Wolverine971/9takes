<p class="firstLetter">Addiction is an equal opportunity destroyer, but it doesn't affect everyone equally.</p>

Each Enneagram type has unique vulnerabilities to addiction, preferred substances or behaviors, and distinct paths to recovery. Understanding your type's patterns can be the difference between white-knuckling sobriety and finding sustainable freedom.

This guide explores how addiction manifests in each Enneagram type, why certain types gravitate toward specific addictions, and most importantly, how to tailor recovery to your personality's needs.
