<QuickAnswer question="Is Type 6 the only anxious Enneagram type?">
No. Every type experiences anxiety differently. Type 1s have perfectionist anxiety (fear of being wrong), Type 2s have rejection anxiety (fear of not being needed), Type 3s have failure anxiety (fear of worthlessness), Type 4s have identity anxiety (fear of being ordinary), Type 5s have depletion anxiety (fear of incompetence), Type 6s have security anxiety (fear of being without support), Type 7s have constraint anxiety (fear of pain), Type 8s have vulnerability anxiety (fear of being controlled), and Type 9s have conflict anxiety (fear of disconnection).

This comprehensive guide explores how each Enneagram type experiences different forms of anxiety, from social anxiety to panic disorders, and provides evidence-based strategies tailored to each personality's needs.
