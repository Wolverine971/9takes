<p class="firstLetter">Neurodivergence doesn't replace personalityâ€”it colors how personality expresses itself.</p>

When neurodivergent brain wiring meets Enneagram personality patterns, the result is a unique expression that can't be understood through either lens alone. This guide explores how conditions like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and others interact with each Enneagram type, creating distinct challenges and strengths.

Understanding this intersection helps neurodivergent individuals and their loved ones develop strategies that honor both their neurological needs and their personality-driven motivations.

## Understanding the Intersection

### Key Principles

1. **Neurodivergence is neurological**: Brain differences that affect processing
2. **Enneagram is motivational**: Core fears, desires, and coping patterns
3. **Both interact**: Creating unique expressions and needs
4. **Neither defines you**: You are more than labels

### Common Neurodivergent Conditions We'll Explore

- **ADHD** (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder**
- **Dyslexia** (Reading differences)
- **Dyspraxia** (Motor coordination)
- **Sensory Processing Differences**
- **Twice Exceptional** (Gifted + Neurodivergent)

### How They Interact

Neurodivergence can:
- **Amplify** type patterns (e.g., ADHD Type 7)
- **Mask** type patterns (e.g., Autistic Type 2)
- **Complicate** type patterns (e.g., Dyslexic Type 5)
- **Transform** type patterns (e.g., ADHD Type 1)
