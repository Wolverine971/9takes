<p class="firstLetter">Every child struggles sometimes, but knowing your child's Enneagram type can help you spot when normal struggles become concerning patterns.</p>

While children are still developing and shouldn't be rigidly typed, understanding Enneagram patterns can help parents recognize their child's natural temperament, stress responses, and mental health vulnerabilities. This guide helps you support your child's mental health in type-appropriate ways while knowing when professional help is needed.

## Understanding Children and the Enneagram
