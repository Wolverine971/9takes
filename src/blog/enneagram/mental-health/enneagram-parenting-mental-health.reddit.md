## Content Strategy by Subreddit

### r/Enneagram Content

#### Post 1: Educational Discussion

**Title:** "How I use the Enneagram to understand my children's mental health needs (without typing them)"

**Content:**
I've been studying the Enneagram for about 5 years, and recently I've started noticing how understanding the 9 patterns helps me support my kids' emotional wellbeing in different ways.

**Important note:** I'm NOT typing my children. They're still developing and that wouldn't be appropriate. But I am noticing temperament patterns that align with Enneagram observations.

**What I've noticed:**

**Child A (shows perfectionist patterns):**

- Gets extremely upset when things don't go "right"
- Very self-critical when making mistakes
- Needs extra support around flexibility and self-compassion

**How this helps:** Instead of just saying "it's okay to make mistakes," I validate their standards while helping them develop self-compassion.

**Child B (shows helper patterns):**

- Always wants to take care of everyone else
- Has trouble identifying their own needs
- Gets emotional when their help isn't appreciated

**How this helps:** I specifically ask about THEIR needs and feelings, not just others.

**Questions for the community:**

- Has anyone else noticed how understanding the patterns helps with parenting?
- What insights have been most helpful?
- How do you balance awareness with not putting kids in boxes?

**Discussion prompts:**

- Share experiences with type-aware parenting
- Discuss how your own type affects your parenting style
- Exchange practical tips for supporting different temperaments

#### Post 2: Experience Sharing

**Title:** "Realized my Type 6 anxiety was affecting how I interpreted my child's behavior"

**Content:**
Had a bit of a wake-up call recently about how my own type affects my parenting...

As a Type 6, I tend to scan for potential problems and worst-case scenarios. I thought this made me a more attentive parent, but I realized I was interpreting normal childhood behavior through an anxiety lens.

**Examples:**

- My 8-year-old being quiet = "Something's wrong, they're depressed"
- Normal moodiness = "This could be early signs of mental health issues"
- Any risk-taking = "This is dangerous, I need to intervene"

**What helped:**

1. Learning about MY patterns first
2. Understanding that different temperaments express distress differently
3. Distinguishing between my anxiety and actual warning signs

**Now I ask myself:**

- Is this actually concerning, or am I filtering it through my Type 6 lens?
- What would this behavior mean for a child with their temperament?
- Am I responding to the situation or my fear about the situation?

**Result:** I'm more present, less reactive, and my child seems more relaxed too.

**Questions:**

- How has understanding your type changed your parenting?
- What patterns have you had to work through?
- Any other Type 6 parents relate to this?

### r/Parenting Content

#### Post 1: Resource Sharing

**Title:** "Mental health warning signs in children - what I learned from temperament research"

**Content:**
After a scare where I wasn't sure if my child's behavior was normal or concerning, I dove deep into research about children's mental health and temperament. Here's what I learned that might help other parents:

**Duration matters more than intensity:**

- One bad day = normal
- One bad week during stress = still normal
- Two weeks of significant changes = time to pay attention

**Look for changes from THEIR baseline:**
Every child is different. A quiet child becoming quieter might be more concerning than an outgoing child having a quiet day.

**Different temperaments show distress differently:**

- Some kids get more defiant when struggling
- Others withdraw completely
- Some become overly helpful or people-pleasing
- Others might regress in development

**When to definitely seek help:**

- Talk of self-harm or not wanting to be alive
- Complete loss of interest in things they used to love
- Significant changes in sleep, appetite, or energy lasting 2+ weeks
- Inability to function at school or with friends

**Trust your gut:**
If something feels "off" about your child's behavior, it's worth talking to someone. Pediatricians are a great first step.

**Resources that helped me:**

- [List appropriate resources]
- Local family therapists who specialize in children
- School counselors for behavioral concerns

**What questions do you have about children's mental health? Happy to share what I learned.**

#### Post 2: Support Request

**Title:** "How do you know when your child's anxiety is 'normal' vs something to address?"

**Content:**
Looking for perspective from other parents. My 9-year-old has always been a bit of a worrier, but lately it seems more intense.

**Background:**

- Always been cautious and thoughtful
- Asks a lot of "what if" questions
- Needs extra reassurance about new situations

**What's changed recently:**

- Waking up at night worried about school
- Physical complaints (stomachaches) before certain activities
- More clingy and needing constant reassurance
- Difficulty making decisions, even small ones

**My questions:**

- How do you distinguish between normal childhood worry and anxiety that needs support?
- Has anyone worked with a therapist for childhood anxiety? How did you know it was time?
- What strategies have helped your anxious kids?

I don't want to overreact, but I also don't want to dismiss something that could help them.

**Update:** Thank you all for the responses. Based on your advice, I think I'm going to talk to our pediatrician first and see what they recommend.

### r/AttachmentParenting Content

#### Post 1: Philosophy Discussion

**Title:** "Attachment parenting with awareness of temperament differences"

**Content:**
I've been thinking about how attachment parenting principles work with different child temperaments and would love to discuss with this community.

**Core AP principles** (as I understand them):

- Responding sensitively to child's needs
- Building secure attachment through attunement
- Respecting the child as an individual

**What I'm wondering:**
Different children have different ways of expressing needs and receiving comfort. Some observations:

**Highly sensitive children:**

- Might need more quiet processing time
- Could be overwhelmed by too much physical comfort
- May need advance warning about transitions

**More extroverted children:**

- Might need more verbal processing
- Could seek more physical comfort
- May need social connection to regulate

**Independent temperaments:**

- Might need space to work through emotions first
- Could resist comfort initially but need it available
- May need respect for their autonomy in how they receive support

**Questions for discussion:**

- How do you balance attachment principles with respecting your child's unique temperament?
- Have you noticed your child needs different types of attunement?
- How do we avoid forcing our own comfort preferences on our children?

I'm especially interested in hearing from parents who have children with very different temperaments from their own.

### r/MentalHealth Content

#### Post 1: Family Mental Health

**Title:** "Breaking generational mental health patterns - what's worked for your family?"

**Content:**
Working on being more intentional about mental health in my family after realizing some unhealthy patterns from my own childhood.

**What I'm trying to change:**

- Making emotions safe to feel and express
- Teaching that asking for help is strength, not weakness
- Normalizing mental health care like we do physical health care
- Building emotional vocabulary and coping skills early

**Practical things we've implemented:**

- Regular family check-ins about feelings
- Reading books about emotions together
- Modeling therapy/self-care as normal adult activities
- Teaching age-appropriate stress management techniques

**Challenges:**

- My own triggers around certain emotions
- Partner and I sometimes have different approaches
- Extended family who don't understand/support this approach
- Knowing when normal struggles cross into needing professional help

**What's working:**

- Kids are more open about difficult feelings
- Less shame around seeking help
- Better emotional regulation in our household overall

**Questions:**

- What generational patterns have you worked to change?
- How do you talk to kids about mental health in age-appropriate ways?
- What resources have been most helpful?
