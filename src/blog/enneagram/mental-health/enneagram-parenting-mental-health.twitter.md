## Thread 1: Early Warning Signs by Type (10 tweets)

🧵 THREAD: How to spot early mental health warning signs in your child based on their temperament.

As an Enneagram-aware parent, you have unique insights. Here's what to watch for: 👇

1/10 First - IMPORTANT disclaimer:

Don't "type" your young child. Instead, watch for patterns that can help you understand their natural temperament and how they might struggle.

Every child is unique. These are general patterns, not rules. 🧠

2/10 **Perfectionist-leaning children** (Type 1 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Excessive self-criticism
- Meltdowns over "mistakes"
- Rigid thinking about right/wrong
- Difficulty with transitions or changes

They might say: "I'm stupid" or "I can't do anything right" 💔

3/10 **Helper-focused children** (Type 2 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Always putting others first, never themselves
- Difficulty expressing their own needs
- Emotional outbursts when not appreciated
- Taking on adult responsibilities

They might say: "Nobody likes me when I don't help" 😢

4/10 **Achievement-oriented children** (Type 3 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Panic over any perceived failure
- Lying about grades or accomplishments
- Exhaustion from over-scheduling
- Identity crisis when not "winning"

They might say: "I have to be the best or I'm nothing" 🏆

5/10 **Sensitive/creative children** (Type 4 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Intense mood swings
- Feeling fundamentally different or flawed
- Withdrawal during difficult emotions
- Dramatic expressions of sadness

They might say: "Nobody understands me" or "I don't belong anywhere" 🎭

6/10 **Quiet/observant children** (Type 5 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Extreme withdrawal from family/friends
- Hoarding behaviors (time, space, energy)
- Difficulty expressing emotions
- Overwhelming anxiety in social situations

They might say very little, but seem increasingly distant 🔍

7/10 **Anxious/loyal children** (Type 6 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Constant worst-case scenario thinking
- Difficulty making decisions alone
- Physical symptoms of anxiety
- Excessive seeking of reassurance

They might say: "What if something bad happens?" repeatedly 😰

8/10 **High-energy/scattered children** (Type 7 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Inability to sit with difficult emotions
- Extreme avoidance of anything "boring" or hard
- Difficulty completing tasks
- Manic-like energy followed by crashes

They might say: "I don't want to think about that" 🎢

9/10 **Strong-willed children** (Type 8 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Extreme anger outbursts
- Difficulty showing vulnerability
- Aggressive responses to feeling controlled
- All-or-nothing thinking

They might say: "I don't need anyone" while clearly struggling 💪

10/10 **Easy-going children** (Type 9 patterns):

⚠️ Warning signs:

- Complete shutdown/withdrawal
- Difficulty expressing any strong emotions
- Passive-aggressive behaviors
- Loss of motivation for things they used to enjoy

They might say: "It doesn't matter" about everything 😶

🔚 Remember: These are WARNING SIGNS, not diagnoses.

Trust your parental instincts. If you notice persistent patterns that concern you, reach out to a mental health professional.

Your awareness is your child's superpower. ✨

## Thread 2: When to Seek Help (6 tweets)

🧵 THREAD: "When should I be worried about my child's mental health?"

This is the question that keeps parents up at night. Here's what mental health professionals want you to know: 👇

1/6 **Duration matters more than intensity.**

One bad day? Normal.
One bad week during a stressful time? Still normal.
Two weeks of significant changes in sleep, appetite, mood, or behavior? Time to pay attention. 📅

2/6 **Trust the "gut feeling" that something's off.**

As a parent, you know your child better than anyone. If their behavior feels significantly different from their baseline, don't dismiss it.

You're not being "dramatic." You're being attentive. 🎯

3/6 **Look for impact on daily functioning:**

- Are they avoiding friends/activities they used to enjoy?
- Significant changes in grades or school behavior?
- Sleep disruptions lasting more than a week?
- Loss of appetite or overeating?

Function > feeling 📊

4/6 **Red flag phrases** (seek help immediately):

- "I wish I was never born"
- "Everyone would be better without me"
- "I don't want to be here anymore"
- Talk of hurting themselves or others

Don't wait. Call a professional today. 🚨

5/6 **You don't need a crisis to seek help.**

Prevention > intervention.

If your child is struggling but not in crisis, therapy can still be incredibly helpful. Think of it like going to the doctor for a persistent cough. 🩺

6/6 **Your mental health matters too.**

If YOU'RE feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or unsure about parenting decisions, getting support helps your whole family.

You can't pour from an empty cup. 💜

💡 Parenting truth: Your Enneagram type influences how you interpret your child's behavior.

Type 1s might see defiance where there's actually overwhelm.
Type 6s might see danger where there's normal risk-taking.

Know your lens. It affects everything you see. 🔍

Mental health support for children shouldn't be stigmatized—it should be normalized.

Just like we take kids to the doctor for physical health, we should support their emotional health too. 🧠💚
