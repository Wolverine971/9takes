<p class="firstLetter">Your trauma response isn't random. It's as predictable as your Enneagram type—and that's your way out.</p>

Every type developed specific survival strategies in childhood. Type 8s learned to attack first. Type 9s learned to disappear. Type 3s learned to outrun their pain through achievement.

These patterns saved you then. They're killing you now.

## The Four F's: How Your Type Survives Trauma

**Fight (Types 8, 1, counterphobic 6):** You learned that offense is the best defense. Control everything, trust no one, attack before being attacked.

**Flight (Types 7, 3, some 6s):** You learned to outrun pain. Stay busy, achieve more, never stop moving—if trauma can't catch you, it can't hurt you.

**Freeze (Types 5, 9, 4):** You learned to play dead. Withdraw, dissociate, disappear—if you're not really here, you can't really be hurt.

**Fawn (Types 2, 9, some 6s):** You learned to appease danger. Please everyone, need nothing, merge completely—if you're useful enough, you'll be safe.

### Where Your Type Stores Trauma

**Body Types (8, 9, 1):** Your trauma lives in your muscles. That chronic tension? That's old pain you're still fighting.

**Heart Types (2, 3, 4):** Your trauma corrupted your identity. You don't know who you are without your wounds.

**Head Types (5, 6, 7):** Your trauma loops in your mind. Anxiety, rumination, catastrophizing—your brain won't stop replaying danger.

## Type 1: The Perfectionist

**Your wound:** "I was punished for making mistakes."

**What broke you:** Harsh criticism. Chaotic homes requiring a perfect child. Religious rigidity. Being the family's moral compass at age 7.

**Your trauma response:** Fight against imperfection while freezing your emotions. You turned anger inward until your jaw locked and shoulders became armor. Your inner critic is a prison guard who never sleeps.

**How it shows up now:**

- OCD behaviors that feel like life or death
- Can't relax without guilt
- Body holds so much tension you're basically a human fist
- Self-compassion feels like moral failure

### What Actually Heals Type 1s

**Body work first:** Your trauma lives in your muscles. Massage, yoga, somatic therapy—release the physical prison before addressing the mental one.

**IFS for the inner critic:** That voice isn't you. It's a scared child trying to keep you safe through perfection.

**Anger work:** You're sitting on rage. Find safe ways to let it move—boxing, screaming in your car, breaking plates in a controlled setting.

**Daily medicine:**

- Morning mantra: "I am already enough"
- Scheduled fuck-up time (yes, really)
- One thing done badly on purpose

**Your healing truth:** Perfection was never the goal. It was the cage.

## Type 2: The Helper

**Your wound:** "I was only loved when I was useful."

**What broke you:** Emotional neglect disguised as independence. Narcissistic parents who needed a therapist, not a child. Being mommy's helper while your needs disappeared.

**Your trauma response:** Fawn until you're invisible, then fight for scraps of connection. You people-please compulsively while your heart literally hurts from giving itself away.

**How it shows up now:**

- Can't identify a single need without checking everyone else first
- Resentment volcano waiting to explode
- Manipulation tactics when desperate
- Burnout is your default state

### What Actually Heals Type 2s

**Attachment repair:** EFT to learn that love doesn't require performance. Group therapy to practice receiving without giving.

**Boundary boot camp:** DBT for interpersonal effectiveness. Your body needs to learn what "no" feels like somatically.

**Solo missions:** Take yourself on dates. Journal about YOUR desires. Create art no one will see.

**Daily medicine:**

- Morning question: "What do I need?" (not want—NEED)
- Say no without explaining why
- Receive one thing without reciprocating

**Your healing truth:** You were loveable before you lifted a finger.

## Type 3: The Achiever

**Your wound:** "I was a trophy, not a child."

**What broke you:** Love came with performance reviews. Narcissistic parents who needed you to make them look good. Being compared until you forgot who you were.

**Your trauma response:** Flight into achievement, fighting anyone in your way. You're running so fast from your feelings that burnout is inevitable. Your identity is a LinkedIn profile.

**How it shows up now:**

- Impostor syndrome is your roommate
- Rest feels like death
- Without achievements, you don't exist
- Emotions are inefficient so you deleted them

### What Actually Heals Type 3s

**Gestalt to get present:** You can't perform your way through real-time confrontation.

**Somatic therapy:** Your body remembers who you were before the performance began.

**EMDR for achievement trauma:** Process the moments when love became conditional.

**Daily medicine:**

- Meditation without measuring progress
- Share one real failure daily
- Celebrate existing, not achieving

**Your healing truth:** You were worthy at birth. Everything since has been unnecessary proof.

## Type 4: The Individualist

**Your wound:** "I was abandoned for being myself."

**What broke you:** Early loss that felt personal. Being the weird kid. Parents who couldn't handle your intensity. Siblings who belonged while you didn't.

**Your trauma response:** Freeze in melancholy, flee into fantasy. You're drowning in feelings while searching for an identity that feels real. Your suffering became your identity.

**How it shows up now:**

- Depression is your baseline
- Identity changes hourly
- Self-sabotage when things go well
- Push people away, then panic when they leave

### What Actually Heals Type 4s

**DBT for the emotional tsunami:** Learn to surf the waves instead of drowning.

**Narrative therapy:** Rewrite your victim story. You're the author now.

**EMDR for abandonment:** Process the original wound without reliving it.

**Daily medicine:**

- Gratitude for one ordinary thing
- Body scan when emotions flood
- Same routine for 30 days straight

**Your healing truth:** Your abandonment wasn't personal. Your intensity isn't too much. You belong.

## Type 5: The Investigator

**Your wound:** "I was invaded and had nowhere to hide."

**What broke you:** Intrusive parents who took everything. No privacy, no boundaries, no escape. You learned the mind was the only safe place.

**Your trauma response:** Freeze and withdraw, flee into your head. You're so disconnected from your body you forget to eat. Isolation is oxygen.

**How it shows up now:**

- Social interaction drains you in minutes
- Your body is a stranger
- Hoarding knowledge like it's food
- Asking for help feels like death

### What Actually Heals Type 5s

**Somatic experiencing:** Gentle reconnection to the body you abandoned.

**Tiny steps toward connection:** Individual therapy first. Online groups. Get a cat.

**Window of tolerance work:** Learn your capacity without exceeding it.

**Daily medicine:**

- 5-minute body scan
- Text one human
- State one need out loud

**Your healing truth:** Connection won't consume you. You have enough. You are enough.

## Type 6: The Loyalist

**Your wound:** "The guardians became the danger."

**What broke you:** Caregivers who changed the rules. Authority that betrayed. Gaslighting that made you doubt reality. No solid ground anywhere.

**Your trauma response:** All of them, randomly. Fight, flight, freeze, fawn—you never know which until it happens. Hypervigilance is exhausting but stopping feels dangerous.

**How it shows up now:**

- Anxiety is your co-pilot
- Can't trust yourself or others
- Analysis paralysis on every decision
- Seeing danger where there's none

### What Actually Heals Type 6s

**EMDR for betrayal trauma:** Process without retraumatizing.

**CBT for catastrophic thinking:** Facts over fear projections.

**Build inner authority:** IFS to find your own guidance system.

**Daily medicine:**

- Morning grounding: 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch
- Write facts vs. fears
- One brave thing daily

**Your healing truth:** You survived the betrayal. You can trust yourself now.

  />
</a>

## Type 7: The Enthusiast

**Your wound:** "No one helped me hold the pain."

**What broke you:** Pain without comfort. Chaos without safety. Parents who needed you happy. You learned to run before the hurt could catch you.

**Your trauma response:** Flight is life. Stay busy, stay high, stay anywhere but here. Your addiction isn't to substances—it's to escape itself.

**How it shows up now:**

- Multiple addictions (substances, experiences, people)
- Grief is kryptonite
- FOMO runs your life
- Depression hiding under the party mask

### What Actually Heals Type 7s

**DBT for distress tolerance:** Learn to sit in discomfort without dying.

**Grief therapy:** Finally process what you've been running from.

**EMDR:** Let your brain process trauma without the story.

**Daily medicine:**

- 5 minutes of stillness (yes, it'll feel like torture)
- Write what you actually feel
- One real conversation weekly

**Your healing truth:** The pain you're running from is already inside you. Stop running and face it—it's smaller than you think.

## Type 8: The Challenger

**Your wound:** "Vulnerability got me destroyed."

**What broke you:** Betrayal when you trusted. Abuse when you were small. Having to protect others before protecting yourself. Softness was punished until you became stone.

**Your trauma response:** Fight everything, deny you can freeze or fawn. Dominate or be dominated. Your body is armor, your anger is a weapon, vulnerability is death.

**How it shows up now:**

- Can't say "I need help"
- Relationships die from your intensity
- Anger is your only emotion
- Control everything or lose everything

### What Actually Heals Type 8s

**Safe vulnerability practice:** Men's/women's circles where strength includes tears.

**Somatic therapy:** Feel what's under the rage.

**EMDR for betrayal:** Process the original wound.

**Daily medicine:**

- Name one fear out loud
- Touch yourself gently
- Ask for help with something small

**Your healing truth:** Your softness is your strength. The wall you built is now your prison.

## Type 9: The Peacemaker

**Your wound:** "My existence caused problems."

**What broke you:** Being the invisible child. Mediating parents' fights. Your opinions dismissed until you stopped having them. You learned to disappear in plain sight.

**Your trauma response:** Freeze into numbness, fawn until you vanish. You forgot yourself so thoroughly you don't know who you are. Anger is buried so deep it comes out sideways.

**How it shows up now:**

- Dissociation is your default
- Identity? What identity?
- Anger terrifies you
- Procrastination is self-erasure

### What Actually Heals Type 9s

**Somatic therapy:** Inhabit the body you abandoned.

**Gestalt for finding your voice:** "What do YOU want?" until you answer.

**Bioenergetics:** Your anger is life force, not danger.

**Daily medicine:**

- Morning body wake-up routine
- State one preference (coffee or tea counts)
- Hourly check: "Am I here?"

**Your healing truth:** Your presence doesn't cause conflict. Your needs matter. Your anger is holy.

## The Science: Why Your Type Matters for Healing

### Window of Tolerance

**Narrow window (Types 1, 6):** You flip from fine to fucked in seconds. Anxiety is your baseline.

**Dissociative (Types 5, 9):** You leave your body when stressed. Freeze is home.

**Hyperarousal (Types 7, 8):** You're always ready to fight or flee. Rest feels dangerous.

### Your Nervous System by Type

**Fight/Flight dominant (3, 7, 8):** Sympathetic overdrive. You're burning out.

**Freeze dominant (4, 5, 9):** Dorsal vagal shutdown. You're checked out.

**Mixed (1, 2, 6):** Swinging between extremes. No middle ground.

### What Each Center Needs

**Body types (8, 9, 1):** Move the trauma out physically
**Heart types (2, 3, 4):** Emotional witnesses and mirrors
**Head types (5, 6, 7):** Understanding before feeling

## The Truth About Your Trauma

Your trauma response saved your life. That fight, flight, freeze, or fawn response? That was brilliance under fire. A child's genius solution to an impossible situation.

But here's the thing: You're not in danger anymore. The war is over, but you're still in combat mode.

Your Enneagram type shows you exactly how you survived—and exactly how to heal. The pattern that saved you is now the prison. But you built it, which means you can dismantle it.

**The non-negotiables:**

- Healing happens in relationship
- The body keeps the score
- You can't think your way out
- Professional help isn't optional

**Your next move:**

Book the therapist. Read the book for your type. Do one daily practice. Start where you are.

You survived the trauma. You'll survive the healing.
