                Let's cut through the noise. Everyone's suddenly "discovering" they're neurodivergent, and frankly, it's getting ridiculous. TikTok has turned brain differences into personality accessories, and people are collecting diagnoses like they're Pokemon cards. Time for some straight talk. 🎭

                    Here's the brutal truth about neurodiversity: <strong>it's binary.</strong> You're either neurodivergent or you're not. There's no middle ground, no "a little bit ADHD," no "slightly on the spectrum."

                <p>
                    Neurodiversity refers to hardwired brain differences present from birth—ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia. These aren't personality quirks you can turn on and off. They're fundamental differences in how your brain developed and processes information. Period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But here's what's happening: People are desperately searching for explanations for why they feel different, why they struggle, why they don't fit the mold. So they latch onto neurodiversity as their golden ticket to understanding themselves.

                    Everyone wants to be special. Everyone wants their struggles validated with a clinical explanation. Social media has turned neurodiversity into a trend, complete with aesthetic graphics and relatable memes.

                    Remember that scene from <em>The Incredibles</em> where Dash's mom tells him everyone's special, and he fires back, "Which is another way of saying no one is"? That's exactly what's happening here. If everyone's neurodivergent, then no one is.

                    Every single person on this planet has quirks, struggles, patterns, and ways of being that don't fit some imaginary standard. Every person has moments of inattention, social awkwardness, repetitive behaviors, or intense interests. That's called being human, not being neurodivergent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The difference is that neurodivergent people experience these things to such a degree that it significantly impacts their daily functioning from childhood onward. The rest of us? We're just navigating the beautiful, messy complexity of human personality.

                <p>
                    While everyone's busy hunting for neurodivergent labels, they're missing the real goldmine: personality systems. Specifically, the most powerful one we have—the Enneagram. 💎
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the alphabet soup of online quizzes and surface-level personality tests, the Enneagram doesn't just tell you <em>what</em> you do. It tells you <em>why</em> you do it. And that "why" runs deep—deeper than most people are willing to go.

                Why the Enneagram Dominates Every Other System

                <p class="text-xl font-bold mb-0">
                    The Enneagram is the heavyweight champion of personality systems, and here's why: it's the only system that fearlessly dives into the two things most people spend their entire lives avoiding—<strong>emotions and childhood wounds.</strong>

                <p>
                    Think about it. When do most people actually explore their emotional patterns? When do they examine how their childhood shaped their adult coping mechanisms? Usually only when they're sitting in a therapist's office because something's broken, their relationships are falling apart, or their old strategies have stopped working.

                        <span><strong>There isn't enough time in the day to explore our emotions.</strong> We're too busy, too distracted, too uncomfortable with sitting in those feelings. We'd rather scroll TikTok looking for ADHD symptoms than face why we really procrastinate.</span>

                    When you understand that your chronic people-pleasing comes from a deep fear of conflict (hello, Type 9), you can start making different choices. When you realize your perfectionism is actually about avoiding criticism (looking at you, Type 1), you can begin to ease up on yourself.
