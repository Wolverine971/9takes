<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-8">Personality Maxing: Using the Enneagram to Max Out Your Personality</h1>

<div class="bg-primary-100 border-l-4 border-primary-600 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
Look, this is going to sound clickbaity and unrealistic - thinking that you can max out your personality. But we're going to try anyway.
</div>

<p>You've heard of "looks maxing" - there is such a thing as that. However, what people should be doing is attempting to max out their personality.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Mental Health Paradigm We're Missing</h2>

<p>Maybe this idea is too soon and people aren't ready for it. Because therapy and mental health is kinda still taboo.</p>

<p>But that's just old thinking. People only check in with their mental health when things are going wrong. But they should be proactively working on their mental health. Similar to how someone should go to the gym to be physically healthy, people in the future will be going to therapy to <span class="bg-warning-100 px-2 py-1 rounded font-semibold">mentally freshen up, lose weight and shed mental baggage</span>.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Personality Maxing Actually Looks Like</h2>

<p>Personality maxing is about taking a proactive approach to mental health and becoming mentally strong. We don't really have imagery around this idea right now but in the future we will. For now picture <span class="bg-warning-100 px-2 py-1 rounded font-semibold">ancient Greek philosophers who are mentally fit addressing everyday life</span>.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-6 mb-3">The Stoicism Trap</h3>

<p>And the trap is to fall into stoicism.</p>

<p>I don't want to push people to stoicism because being mentally fit is about dealing with your emotions in a healthy way and not suppressing them.</p>

<div class="bg-warning-50 border border-warning-200 border-l-4 border-l-warning-500 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
<strong>Ask a girl if she wants you to ignore your emotions and she will say no.</strong> If you ignore your own emotions you won't be able to handle your girl's emotions.
</div>

<p>You need to demonstrate that you can control and in a healthy way express your emotions. In doing so that signals confidence and is attractive.</p>

<p>That is what you get when you start using the Enneagram to max out your personality.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">TLDR on the Enneagram</h2>

<p>There are <strong>3 core emotions</strong> that shape a personality.<br>
There are <strong>3 different ways/strategies</strong> of handling those emotions.<br>
That is how you get <strong>9 personality types</strong> or worldviews, or life strategies.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-6 mb-3">The Three Core Emotions</h3>

<p>The three core emotions that shape your personality are <span class="bg-warning-100 px-2 py-1 rounded font-semibold">anger, fear and shame</span>.<br>
Though these emotions are negative they correspond to a certain intelligence.</p>

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 my-8">
    <div class="bg-neutral-50 border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg p-6 text-center">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Intellectual/Thinking/Head Intelligence</h4>
        <p class="text-neutral-600">Ability to think clearly and reason</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-neutral-50 border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg p-6 text-center">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Emotional/Feeling/Heart Intelligence</h4>
        <p class="text-neutral-600">Ability to empathize and sense feelings</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-neutral-50 border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg p-6 text-center">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Instinctual/Body Intelligence</h4>
        <p class="text-neutral-600">Being in tune with your body and desires and instincts</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-6 mb-3">Your Childhood Wound Is Still Running the Show</h3>

<p>This makes sense because every therapist wants to talk about your childhood and try to get at pivotal moments in your childhood. In the enneagram world your childhood is important because somewhere in there you got a childhood wound that didn't quite heal. Could have happened in a number of ways:</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
<li>Something that you were repeatedly told</li>
<li>An incident that forever changed you</li>
<li>Neglect in a certain way from your parents</li>
</ul>

<p>Somehow we are still recovering from our childhoods and as we grew we developed coping skills to deal with these core emotions.</p>

<p>In childhood we learned how to deal with anger, fear and shame. But the enneagram teaches that we have an <span class="bg-warning-100 px-2 py-1 rounded font-semibold">underdeveloped relationship to one of those emotions</span>. We didn't quite fully develop coping mechanisms in response to that emotion.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Finding Your Core Emotion</h2>

<p>There is a lot to process there. But the first step to personality maxing is figuring out which emotion do you have an unhealthy relationship with.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can tell if you ask yourself, who do you empathize with.</p>

<p>Do you empathize with people who are angry, or people who are fearful, or people who feel shame? Shame is kinda tricky - it's kinda like being insecure.</p>

<p>You likely will have more patience for someone who is expressing one of those emotions over the other. You can empathize with someone experiencing one of those emotions more than the others. That should give you a clue into the emotion that relates to your personality.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>At this point you should be ready for me to connect these dots.</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
<li><strong>Intellectual/thinking/head intelligence</strong> → fear</li>
<li><strong>Emotional/feeling/heart intelligence</strong> → shame</li>
<li><strong>Instinctual/body intelligence</strong> → anger</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<div class="bg-neutral-100 border-l-4 border-neutral-500 p-6 text-center text-xl font-bold rounded-lg my-8">
Did ya think about it?
</div>

<p>If you didn't think about it go to <a href="https://9takes.com/enneagram-corner/philosophy-psychology-and-the-enneagram" class="text-primary-700 hover:text-primary-800 underline">this link to get a deeper breakdown</a>. TLDR: Plato talked about the human soul consisting of three parts and Freud talked about the human psyche consisting of three parts but they were both circling around the ideas of the Enneagram. (In that article it goes more in-depth about how the 3 core emotions are connected to specific intelligences.)</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Back to Personality Maxing!</h2>

<p>Each enneagram type interacts with their core emotion in a different way. You can either:</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
<li>Suppress that emotion</li>
<li>Actively use that emotion</li>
<li>Have that emotion in the back of mind subconsciously influencing you</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-6 mb-3">The 9 Types Breakdown</h3>

<div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
<p class="mb-6">This is the breakdown of how that works:</p>

<div class="mb-6 p-4 bg-white border-l-4 border-error-500 rounded-lg">
<strong class="text-error-700">Anger:</strong>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
<li>Uses it → enneagram type 8</li>
<li>In subconscious → enneagram type 9</li>
<li>Suppresses it → enneagram type 1</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-6 p-4 bg-white border-l-4 border-warning-500 rounded-lg">
<strong class="text-warning-700">Shame:</strong>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
<li>Uses it → enneagram type 2</li>
<li>In subconscious → enneagram type 3</li>
<li>Suppresses it → enneagram type 4</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-6 p-4 bg-white border-l-4 border-info-500 rounded-lg">
<strong class="text-info-700">Fear:</strong>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
<li>Uses it → enneagram type 5</li>
<li>In subconscious → enneagram type 6</li>
<li>Suppresses it → enneagram type 7</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now this is just the surface level.</p>

<p>Think about the coping skills of someone who actively uses anger. And think about the personality type that develops from that. Now think about the person who suppresses their own shame and insecurity. Now think about the person who is subconsciously driven by fear.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Personality Maxing Strategy</h2>

<p>There is a lot going on but each negative emotion is correlated to a particular intelligence -- remember that. This is where you can start to look at personality maxing.</p>

<div class="bg-warning-50 border border-warning-200 border-l-4 border-l-warning-500 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
<strong>How can you maximize the specific intelligence that you have?</strong> In what situations do you thrive? In what situations should you use caution? What are your patterns, what are the patterns of your personality type?
</div>

<p>All this is just scratching the surface of what you can do to max out your personality by using the enneagram.</p>

<p>This is what the gurus and Enneagram coaches are busy doing. And I am going to start distilling this information into short guides for each type.</p>

<div class="bg-primary-600 text-white p-6 rounded-lg text-center my-8">
<strong class="text-lg">Over the next few days I will be posting brief guides. Stay tuned.</strong>
