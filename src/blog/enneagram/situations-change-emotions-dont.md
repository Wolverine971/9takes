<!-- Enneagram therapy on handling stress

How to be a therapist

How to be your friendly neighborhood therapist (FNT) -->

<p class="firstLetter">Stress affects everyone, but in different ways. And some people get stuck in a cycle.</p>

We've all witnessed someone lose their cool, overreact, or fail to react when they should have. If you were that person's therapist—and not some judgmental observer—you would gently discuss that person's triggers in your next session. But you likely aren't their therapist, and it's easy to overlook the fact that you, too, have your own "triggers."

Read on so hopefully you don't find yourself in a triggering cycle.

## Same Stress, Different Day

Life is full of changing situations, but the emotions they evoke tend to follow predictable patterns. It's a paradox, but let me explain.

Imagine two individuals facing the same stressful situation - let's say, a surprise presentation at work. Person A might consistently react with anxiety, their heart racing and palms sweating. Person B, on the other hand, might feel a surge of excitement and eagerness to prove themselves. These reactions, while different from each other, are likely to be consistent for each person across various high-pressure situations.

As Viktor Frankl wisely noted, **"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response."** This space is where our unique emotional patterns reside, shaping our reactions to stress.

## Our Personality Shapes Our Emotional Responses to Stress (and Vice Versa)

These predictable patterns emerge because our emotional responses are deeply rooted in our personality, past experiences, and ingrained beliefs. They form a kind of **emotional fingerprint**, unique to each individual but consistent across different scenarios. For instance:

1. A "**perfectionist**" might always feel a twinge of anxiety when faced with a task, fearing it won't meet their high standards.
2. A "**natural leader**" might feel a rush of energy and determination when confronted with a challenge, seeing it as an opportunity to shine.
3. A "**peacemaker**" might consistently experience discomfort in conflict situations, instinctively seeking ways to restore harmony.

## Anger, Fear, and Shame: Decoding Stress Reactions

When someone lashes out or overreacts under stress, it's often rooted in one of three core emotions: anger, fear, or shame. These feelings can manifest in various ways, depending on the individual and the situation.

Consider this scenario: a colleague snaps at you for a minor mistake. While it may seem like an overreaction to you, their response is likely driven by an underlying emotion:

- **Anger**: They may feel frustrated, believing that your mistake reflects poorly on them or adds to their workload.
- **Fear**: They might be worried about the consequences of the mistake, such as missed deadlines or negative evaluations.
- **Shame**: They could be embarrassed about not catching the mistake themselves or feel inadequate in their role.

To you, their reaction may seem disproportionate because you're not experiencing the same emotional intensity. However, recognizing the underlying emotion allows you to approach the situation with empathy and understanding.

## Understanding Stress Responses Through the Enneagram

The Enneagram personality typing system is based on anger, fear, and shame. It identifies nine personality types formed in response to these emotions. Each Enneagram type is connected to two others:

1. How they act when thriving
2. How they behave when stressed

To learn more about how each type thinks, feels, and acts under stress, check out this blog post on <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-stress-number">each type's stress number</a>.

## Breaking Free: Mastering Your Emotions and Stress Response

Now that we understand the paradox of stress—that our situations change but our emotional patterns often don't—how can we break free? Here are some practical steps:

1. **Take inventory**: As Marcus Aurelius said, **"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."** Start by taking a weekly inventory of stressful situations that have occurred. Try to name the specific emotions you felt (or the underlying emotions) and note the patterns you observe.

2. **Practice empathy**: When someone reacts strongly to a situation, try to identify which core emotion (anger, fear, or shame) might be driving their response. This can help you respond with empathy and understanding.

3. **Develop self-awareness**: Take an Enneagram test to identify your type. Then, research how your type typically responds to stress. Use this knowledge to develop personalized coping strategies.

4. **Create space**: Remember Frankl's words about the space between stimulus and response. Practice mindfulness techniques to increase this space, giving yourself more time to choose your response consciously.

5. **Embrace emotional duality**: As Nicholas Sparks once said, **"The emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it."** Recognize that your stress responses, while challenging, also hold the key to your growth and resilience.

## From Paradox to Practice- Harness Your Emotional Patterns for a Less Stressful Life

Understanding the stress paradox—that our emotional patterns remain consistent even as situations change—is the first step towards better stress management. By recognizing your unique emotional fingerprint and the underlying core emotions driving your stress responses, you can develop more effective coping strategies.

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate stress entirely, but to master your response to it. As you practice these techniques, you'll find yourself better equipped to navigate life's challenges, turning potential breaking points into opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

Your emotions are powerful tools. Learn to decode them, understand them, and ultimately, let them guide you towards a more resilient and fulfilling life.

<!--
eightfold fence
Purpose and Function
The Eightfold Fence serves as a mental barrier that allows individuals to:
Compartmentalize their emotions
Separate personal views from professional obligations
Maintain composure in difficult situations
Carry out duties without compromising their inner selves
Key Characteristics
Mental Retreat: It provides an internal safe space where one can retain individuality and control.
Emotional Regulation: Helps in managing feelings, especially when faced with challenging circumstances.
Duality of Behavior: Enables people to act professionally while preserving personal beliefs.
Coping Mechanism: Particularly useful for those in subordinate positions or facing adversity.
Cultural Context
The concept is deeply rooted in Japanese history and mythology:
The term originates from ancient Japanese poetry, specifically the oldest waka poem.
It's associated with the number 8, which has sacred significance in Japanese culture.
While not historically accurate, the show uses this concept to explain certain behaviors in feudal Japanese society.
Application in Shōgun
In the show, characters like Mariko, Fuji, and others demonstrate the use of the Eightfold Fence to:
Navigate complex political and social situations
Maintain dignity and inner strength in the face of hardship
Fulfill duties that may conflict with personal feelings
The Eightfold Fence is presented as a tool for maintaining sanity and composure in a society with strict hierarchies and expectations, allowing individuals to reconcile their inner selves with external demands. -->
