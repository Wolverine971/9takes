## Enneagram intro/ background

The Enneagram is a powerful tool for understanding yourself and the people around you. It's a personality system that identifies nine distinct types of people, each with their unique worldview, motivations, and fears. In this article, we're going to talk about one of the most important aspects of the Enneagram: the stress number.

## Understanding your place of comfort and stress

Each Enneagram type has a place of comfort and a place of stress. Your place of comfort is the number on the Enneagram that describes your natural state of being. It's where you feel most at home, where you're most comfortable in your own skin. Your place of stress, on the other hand, is the number that represents the opposite of your natural state. It's where you feel most out of place, where you're most likely to struggle.

Knowing your stress number can be incredibly valuable because it helps you understand yourself better. When you're in a place of stress, you're likely to experience all sorts of negative emotions, such as anxiety, frustration, anger or feeling like everyone is against you. You might also exhibit behavior that you're not proud of, such as being controlling, manipulative, or passive-aggressive. Mentally and emotionally when you are in that state you start acting like another enneagram type.

## Why it's hard to interact with enneagram types that are your stress number

The thing about your stress number is that it's the number that you act like when you are at your worst. It can be hard to interact with people who are your stress number because you might recognize the toxic parts of yourself in that Enneagram type. It is also possible that when you're around that enneagram type, it can trigger your own negative tendencies. You might not even recognize your stress number at first because it might be the number that you least identify with. However, if you pay attention to how you react to stress, you'll start to see patterns that indicate your stress number.

For example, if you're an Enneagram Type 1, your place of stress is Enneagram Type 4. Type 4s are creative, emotional, and intuitive, and can be insecure about their identity which can be a stark contrast to the rational, logical, principled and self assured Type 1. When you're under stress, you might find yourself having an identity crisis and feeling moody.

If you're an Enneagram Type 9, your place of stress is Enneagram Type 6. Type 6s are loyal, skeptical, and anxious, and endlessly examining all worst case scenarios which can be challenging for the peaceful, easy-going Type 9. When you're under stress, you might find yourself acting overthinking things and becoming hype fixated on minute details.

If you're a Type 5, your stress number is Type 7. Type 7s are enthusiastic, adventurous, fun-loving and try to avoid pain by distracting themselves, which can be a stark contrast to the introverted, analytical, and serious Type 5. When you're under stress, you might find yourself acting more more impulsively and being irrationally optimistic.
