<p class="firstLetter">When a relationship is in stress survival strategies can look like toxic traits.</p>

Many behaviors develop as coping mechanisms that help individuals navigate their world. These coping mechanisms stem from core fears or unmet needs. When it comes to relationships these coping mechanisms get some feedback.

The "feedback" isn't always negative. **Sometimes these coping mechanisms or personality traits can be initially attractive.** After all they are developed as a way to keep us safe and meet our needs. But they can harm both partners and the relationship itself. Understanding these patterns through the lens of the Enneagram can offer insight into why certain behaviors emerge and how they impact relationships.

But why do some people find these toxic traits alluring at first?

## The Allure of Toxic Traits

Sometimes, what draws us to a person can be the very thing that later drives us apart.

Toxic traits can appear attractive because they often represent qualities we feel we lack. A person who struggles with assertiveness might admire a partner's domineering behavior, mistaking it for strength. Someone who fears abandonment might interpret possessiveness as a sign of deep love.

These initial attractions, however, often mask deeper issues that can lead to relationship problems down the line.

So how do these traits manifest in different personality types?

## Toxic Traits by Enneagram Type in Relationships

 <article class="section-content">

<h3 id="type">Type 1: The Perfectionist's Relationship Critique</h3>

Type 1s in relationships often exhibit toxic traits stemming from their drive for perfection and fear of moral corruption. Their critical nature, rigidity, and self-righteousness can create significant challenges in romantic partnerships.

#### Relentless Criticism

Type 1s may subject their partners to constant criticism, believing they're helping improve the relationship. This behavior manifests in nitpicking over small details, from how their partner loads the dishwasher to their choice of words in conversations. For example, a Type 1 might repeatedly correct their partner's grammar during casual conversations, gradually eroding their partner's confidence and comfort in expressing themselves.

#### Inflexible Expectations

The rigidity of Type 1s can lead to unrealistic and inflexible expectations in relationships. They might create mental checklists of how a "perfect" partner should behave, often based on arbitrary or idealized standards. This could result in a Type 1 becoming visibly disappointed or frustrated when their partner doesn't follow their precise schedule for household chores or doesn't share their exact vision for how a date night should unfold.

#### Moral Superiority

Type 1s may position themselves as the moral authority in the relationship, leading to a sense of superiority over their partner. This can manifest in lecturing their partner about "right" and "wrong" ways of doing things, or expressing disappointment when their partner doesn't live up to their ethical standards. For instance, a Type 1 might shame their partner for occasionally enjoying reality TV, viewing it as a "waste of time" that doesn't align with their values of productive self-improvement.

<h3 id="type">Type 2: The Helper's Smothering Love</h3>

Type 2s in relationships often display toxic traits rooted in their need to be needed and fear of being unlovable. Their tendency towards emotional manipulation, boundary violations, and self-neglect can create unhealthy dynamics in romantic partnerships.

#### Emotional Manipulation

Type 2s may use their kindness as a tool for manipulation, keeping a mental tally of their good deeds to guilt their partner into reciprocation. For example, a Type 2 might spend hours cooking an elaborate meal for their partner, then use this act of service to pressure their partner into canceling plans with friends, saying, "After all I've done for you, the least you could do is spend the evening with me."

#### Boundary Violations

The Helper's desire to be indispensable can lead to severe boundary issues in relationships. They might consistently overstep their partner's personal space or privacy under the guise of care. This could manifest as a Type 2 reading their partner's private messages "just to make sure they're okay," or showing up uninvited to their partner's work events to offer "support."

#### Self-Neglect

Type 2s often neglect their own needs in favor of their partner's, creating an unsustainable imbalance in the relationship. They might consistently put their partner's desires ahead of their own, leading to resentment and burnout. For instance, a Type 2 might always defer to their partner's choice of restaurant or vacation destination, never expressing their own preferences, until they eventually explode in frustration.

<h3 id="type">Type 3: The Achiever's Image-Driven Love</h3>

Type 3s in relationships often exhibit toxic traits stemming from their fear of worthlessness and drive for success. Their focus on image, competitive nature, and workaholic tendencies can create significant challenges in romantic partnerships.

#### Image Obsession

Type 3s may prioritize how their relationship appears to others over the actual health of the partnership. This can lead to curating a perfect social media presence while neglecting real issues. For example, a Type 3 might insist on frequent couple photos for Instagram, showcasing a seemingly perfect relationship, while avoiding addressing underlying communication problems.

#### Competitive Comparisons

The Achiever's competitive nature can turn relationships into a constant comparison game. They might measure their relationship against others', always striving to be the "power couple." This could manifest as a Type 3 pressuring their partner to attend high-profile events or make career moves simply to outshine other couples in their social circle.

#### Workaholism at the Expense of Intimacy

Type 3s often prioritize work and achievement over their relationship, leading to emotional neglect of their partner. They might consistently cancel date nights for work commitments or be mentally absent even when physically present. For instance, a Type 3 might spend an entire vacation answering work emails and taking calls, leaving their partner feeling lonely and unimportant.

<h3 id="type">Type 4: The Individualist's Dramatic Love</h3>

Type 4s in relationships often display toxic traits rooted in their fear of being ordinary and their search for identity. Their tendency towards emotional volatility, chronic dissatisfaction, and romanticizing pain can create turbulent dynamics in romantic partnerships.

#### Emotional Rollercoaster

Type 4s may subject their partners to extreme mood swings, expecting them to ride the waves of their intense emotions. This can create an exhausting and unstable relationship environment. For example, a Type 4 might be deeply in love one day, showering their partner with affection, only to withdraw completely the next day, leaving their partner confused and hurt.

#### Perpetual Dissatisfaction

The Individualist's quest for the ideal can lead to chronic dissatisfaction with their relationship. They might constantly feel that something is missing, even in a healthy partnership. This could manifest as a Type 4 regularly threatening to end the relationship because it doesn't match their fantasy of perfect love, keeping their partner in a constant state of insecurity.

#### Romanticizing Relationship Pain

Type 4s may glorify the painful aspects of their relationship, seeing suffering as a sign of depth and authenticity. They might create or exaggerate problems to feel a sense of emotional intensity. For instance, a Type 4 might pick fights with their partner before important events, believing that the ensuing drama and reconciliation will make the occasion more meaningful and memorable.

<h3 id="type">Type 5: The Investigator's Detached Love</h3>

Type 5s in relationships often exhibit toxic traits stemming from their fear of depletion and need for self-sufficiency. Their emotional detachment, hoarding of personal space, and intellectual superiority can create significant challenges in romantic partnerships.

#### Emotional Unavailability

Type 5s may struggle to connect emotionally with their partners, often retreating into their minds rather than engaging with feelings. This can leave their partners feeling isolated and unloved. For example, a Type 5 might respond to their partner's emotional distress with logical solutions rather than empathy, failing to provide the emotional support their partner needs.

#### Extreme Privacy

The Investigator's need for personal space can become excessive in relationships. They might guard their time, energy, and personal information zealously, even from their partner. This could manifest as a Type 5 refusing to share details about their day or consistently needing large amounts of alone time, leaving their partner feeling shut out and unimportant.

#### Intellectual One-upmanship

Type 5s may use their knowledge as a defense mechanism in relationships, creating an imbalance of power. They might constantly correct their partner or engage in debates to assert intellectual superiority. For instance, a Type 5 might undermine their partner's opinions in social situations by presenting counterarguments or obscure facts, embarrassing their partner and damaging their confidence.

 <article class="section-content">

<h3 id="type">Type 6: The Loyalist's Anxious Love</h3>

Type 6s in relationships often display toxic traits rooted in their fear of abandonment and need for security. Their tendency towards suspicion, worst-case scenario thinking, and testing loyalty can create stressful dynamics in romantic partnerships.

#### Constant Suspicion

Type 6s may subject their partners to ongoing doubt and questioning, always looking for signs of potential betrayal. This can create an atmosphere of mistrust in the relationship. For example, a Type 6 might frequently check their partner's phone or social media accounts, looking for evidence of infidelity where none exists.

#### Catastrophic Thinking

The Loyalist's tendency to anticipate the worst can lead to excessive worry about the relationship's future. They might constantly prepare for potential breakups or relationship problems, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. This could manifest as a Type 6 regularly asking their partner, "Are you going to leave me?" or jumping to dire conclusions from minor disagreements.

#### Loyalty Tests

Type 6s may create scenarios to test their partner's commitment, often setting them up for failure. These tests can be exhausting and damaging to the relationship. For instance, a Type 6 might deliberately not respond to messages for hours, then become upset if their partner doesn't show enough concern about their whereabouts.

<h3 id="type">Type 7: The Enthusiast's Escapist Love</h3>

Type 7s in relationships often exhibit toxic traits stemming from their fear of pain and desire for constant stimulation. Their commitment phobia, attention deficit, and avoidance of deep emotional connection can create significant challenges in romantic partnerships.

#### Commitment Avoidance

Type 7s may struggle with fully committing to their relationships, always keeping an eye out for better options. This can leave their partners feeling insecure and undervalued. For example, a Type 7 might refuse to define the relationship or make long-term plans, keeping their partner in a state of uncertainty.

#### Attention Deficit in Relationships

The Enthusiast's need for constant stimulation can lead to a lack of focus on their partner's needs. They might constantly seek new experiences at the expense of nurturing their relationship. This could manifest as a Type 7 planning elaborate dates but struggling to engage in meaningful conversations about the relationship's future.

#### Emotional Superficiality

Type 7s may avoid deep emotional intimacy, preferring to keep things light and fun. This can prevent the development of a truly close bond. For instance, a Type 7 might deflect serious discussions with jokes or change the subject when their partner tries to address relationship issues, leaving problems unresolved.

 <article class="section-content">

<h3 id="type">Type 8: The Challenger's Domineering Love</h3>

Type 8s in relationships often display toxic traits rooted in their fear of vulnerability and need for control. Their tendency towards domination, excessive anger, and emotional guardedness can create power imbalances in romantic partnerships.

#### Control and Domination

Type 8s may attempt to control various aspects of the relationship and their partner's life, often under the guise of protection. This can stifle their partner's independence and growth. For example, an Type 8 might make important decisions without consulting their partner or pressure them to change jobs to one the Type 8 deems more suitable.

#### Anger as a Defense

The Challenger's quick temper can lead to frequent outbursts in the relationship, creating an atmosphere of fear or walking on eggshells. They might use anger to maintain control or avoid showing vulnerability. This could manifest as a Type 8 responding to their partner's minor mistakes with disproportionate rage, damaging trust and emotional safety in the relationship.

#### Emotional Fortress

Type 8s may struggle with showing softer emotions, maintaining a tough exterior even with their partner. This can prevent deep emotional intimacy from developing. For instance, a Type 8 might respond to their partner's expressions of love with sarcasm or deflection, leaving their partner feeling emotionally unfulfilled and disconnected.

<h3 id="type">Type 9: The Peacemaker's Passive Love</h3>

Type 9s in relationships often exhibit toxic traits stemming from their fear of conflict and desire for inner peace. Their tendency towards passive-aggression, emotional numbness, and self-erasure can create significant challenges in romantic partnerships.

#### Conflict Avoidance at All Costs

Type 9s may go to extreme lengths to avoid addressing relationship issues, allowing problems to fester and grow. This can lead to unresolved resentment and a breakdown in communication. For example, a Type 9 might consistently agree with their partner's choices, even when they strongly disagree, only to later express their dissatisfaction through subtle acts of rebellion or withdrawal.

#### Emotional Numbing

The Peacemaker's desire for internal harmony can lead to a suppression of their own emotions, creating an emotional disconnect in the relationship. They might struggle to engage with or express strong feelings, positive or negative. This could manifest as a Type 9 responding with indifference to their partner's expressions of love or failing to show appropriate concern during relationship crises.

#### Self-Erasure

Type 9s may lose themselves in their relationships, adapting to their partner's preferences and lifestyle at the expense of their own identity. This can lead to a loss of self and an unhealthy codependence. For instance, a Type 9 might completely abandon their own hobbies, friends, and even career aspirations to merge with their partner's life, ultimately leading to a sense of resentment and loss of self-esteem.

## Addressing Toxic Traits: Principles and Questions

Recognizing toxic traits is just the first step. How can we address them effectively?

1. Foster self-awareness: Encourage introspection about motivations behind behaviors.
2. Practice open communication: Create a safe space for honest dialogue about concerns.
3. Set healthy boundaries: Establish clear limits while respecting each other's needs.
4. Seek growth opportunities: View challenges as chances for personal and relational development.
5. Consider professional help: Recognize when issues might benefit from outside guidance.

The key is to approach these conversations with curiosity and compassion, not judgment.

## Asking Good Questions: Unveiling True Character

Questions can reveal more about a person than any self-description. Here are some examples:

1. "What's a mistake you've made that taught you an important lesson?"
2. ["How do you typically handle disagreements with close friends or family?"](/questions/typically-handle-disagreements-close-friends-family)
3. "What's something you're working on improving about yourself?"
4. "Can you tell me about a time when you had to admit you were wrong?"
5. "How do you balance your own needs with those of others in your life?"

These questions can uncover values, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness.

## Conclusion

Toxic traits in relationships often mask deeper needs and fears.

By understanding these patterns through the Enneagram, we can approach relationship challenges with greater empathy and insight. Remember, the goal isn't to label or judge, but to foster growth, understanding, and healthier connections. As we become more aware of our own tendencies and those of our partners, we open the door to more authentic and fulfilling relationships.

What steps will you take to bring more awareness and compassion to your relationships?
