<p class="firstLetter">Relationships thrive on open communication.</p>

Yet so many couples struggle to have the crucial conversations that can make or break their bond. Just tune into any episode of Dr. Phil and you'll see the fallout from failing to express needs, desires, and fears openly with a partner. 

This blog post will draw on the relationship research from the Gottman Institute and insights from the Enneagram personality system. Here it will outline 5 essential conversations every couple needs to have or they are not going to make it.

The Gottman Institute, founded by Drs. John and Julie Gottman, has conducted over 40 years of research on what makes relationships succeed or fail. 

And the Enneagram describes nine distinct personality types, each with its own core motivations, fears, and behavior patterns.

If you and your partner avoid these conversations, YNGMI - You're Nearing Grave Misery and Isolation. But by diving in and discussing these 5 key topics, you'll build the foundation for a relationship that can withstand life's toughest challenges.

Let's explore these make or break conversations.

## I. Understanding Your Partner's Core Emotions 
Do you know what really makes your partner tick? What childhood wounds still sting, triggering strong emotional reactions?

Each Enneagram type has a core sensitivity to one of three emotion triads - anger, shame, or fear. Anger includes frustration, irritation, annoyance and hostility. Shame involves feelings of unworthiness, inadequacy, and humiliation. Fear spans from mild anxiety to sheer terror.

Here are the nine types and their core emotional vice or passion:
1. Type 1: Anger - Ones repress anger to maintain a self-righteous stance. 
2. Type 2: Pride - Twos need to be needed, stemming from inverted pride.
3. Type 3: Deceit - Threes deceive themselves and others to maintain an image of success.
4. Type 4: Envy - Fours feel deficient compared to others, leading to envy.  
5. Type 5: Avarice - Fives withhold resources and energy out of fear of depletion.
6. Type 6: Fear - Sixes are beset by fear and anxiety, leading to continual doubt. 
7. Type 7: Gluttony - Sevens avoid emotional pain by overindulging in stimulation and experiences.
8. Type 8: Lust - Eights dominate and control due to an unconscious fear of being harmed.
9. Type 9: Sloth - Nines avoid conflict and numb out to maintain a false peace.

By understanding your partner's core emotion and childhood wound, you can attune to their innermost needs and sensitivities with empathy and care. The Gottman Institute emphasizes the importance of "turning towards" your partner - recognizing and responding to their emotional bids for connection. 

When you identify your partner's emotional landscape, you gain a roadmap for how to love them well. You sidestep the landmines and unlock the gateways to their heart.

## II. Discussing the Four Horsemen
If the Three Musketeers had a darker counterpart, it would be the Four Horsemen of the Relationship Apocalypse. These communication demons - criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling - can trample a relationship to its demise.

The Gottman Institute has identified these Four Horsemen as harbingers of a relationship's end:
1. Criticism - Attacking your partner's character with blame and accusation. 
2. Contempt - Assuming a position of superiority and treating your partner with disrespect.
3. Defensiveness - Denying responsibility, making excuses, and meeting one complaint with another.  
4. Stonewalling - Withdrawing and shutting down to avoid conflict.

If you spot these Four Horsemen galloping through your conflicts, it's crucial to corral them before they can do more damage. Here are the antidotes:
1. For criticism, use a gentle start-up focused on your feelings and needs.
2. Replace contempt with a culture of appreciation and respect.
3. Counter defensiveness by taking responsibility for your role.
4. Prevent stonewalling by self-soothing and taking breaks to calm down.

By learning to spot the Four Horsemen and applying their antidotes, you can stop a negative cycle from spiraling out of control. You create a climate of safety and respect, even in the midst of conflict.

Taming the Four Horsemen is an ongoing process, but it's one of the most important conversations you can have to protect your bond.

## III. Establishing a Shared Vision
Imagine you're planning a vacation, but your partner thinks you're heading to the mountains while you've got your sights set on the beach. Without a shared vision, you'll end up pulling in different directions and arriving at Destination Disappointment.

The same principle applies to your life together. If you don't discuss your individual dreams and find a way to merge them, you'll be living separate lives under the same roof. But when you take the time to dive deep and discover what really matters to each of you, magic happens. 

Try asking questions like:
- "What legacy do you want to leave? What impact do you hope to have on the world?"
- "When you picture us 10 years from now, what does our life look like? What adventures have we had? What have we created together?"
- "What's most important to you? What are your non-negotiables and where are you willing to compromise?"

By exploring your individual visions and weaving them together, you create a shared roadmap for your future. Maybe it means living abroad for a year to satisfy your sense of wanderlust, while also pursuing a stable career path to meet your partner's need for security.

When you know you're working towards the same big-picture goals, you'll find more motivation to support each other through the day-to-day challenges. A shared vision becomes the North Star that guides you through life's twists and turns.

## IV. Addressing Conflict Styles
What's your fighting style - do you come out swinging or retreat into stony silence? How about your partner?

The Enneagram outlines three conflict styles that correspond with the emotion triads:
- Positive Outlook Group (Types 2, 7, 9): Avoid conflict to maintain connection.
- Competency Group (Types 1, 3, 5): Focus on facts and objectivity to resolve issues.  
- Reactive Group (Types 4, 6, 8): Intensify emotions and express volatility during conflicts.  

To identify your own and your partner's conflict style:
1. Reflect on your go-to responses during disagreements. Do you minimize issues, present logical arguments, or dig in your heels and emote?
2. Ask your partner how they experience you during a fight. Do they feel heard and validated or ignored and attacked?

Once you understand your conflict dynamic, you can develop a game plan to navigate the rocky rapids:
- If you tend to avoid or minimize, practice expressing your needs directly and setting boundaries. 
- If you get intense and reactive, work on self-soothing and taking time-outs.
- If you default to logic and objectivity, focus on validating emotions and expressing empathy.

When you approach conflicts as an opportunity to understand each other better, you stop seeing your partner as the enemy. Instead, you recognize you're on the same team, fighting for your relationship.

## V. Nurturing Intimacy and Connection
Amidst the daily grind of work-kids-chores-repeat, it's all too easy to drift into roommate mode with your partner. But neglecting your intimate connection is like forgetting to water a houseplant - eventually, it will shrivel up and die.

The Gottman Institute has found that the "Magic Six Hours" - a series of small, daily investments - can keep the spark alive:
1. Partings: Take 2 minutes every morning to really connect before saying goodbye.  
2. Reunions: Spend 20 minutes at the end of each day sharing highlights and struggles.
3. Appreciation: Find ways to express genuine appreciation and admiration.
4. Affection: Offer physical affection consistently, even outside the bedroom. 
5. Weekly dates: Carve out at least 2 hours per week for uninterrupted quality time.
6. Hourly check-ins: Send a quick text or share a long hug - little moments of connection add up.

Different Enneagram types have specific intimacy needs:
1. Ones need to feel respected and appreciated for their integrity.
2. Twos need to feel cherished and central to their partner's life.  
3. Threes need their partner to see behind their successful image.
4. Fours need a deep sense of being fully seen and understood.
5. Fives need plenty of private time balanced with shared interests.
6. Sixes need steadfast reassurance and demonstrations of commitment. 
7. Sevens need adventures and stimulation alongside quiet moments of presence.
8. Eights need to be matched in intensity and to have their vulnerability cherished.
9. Nines need to have their voice drawn out and their presence invited.

Staying intimately connected is like a dance - it requires constant recalibration and attentiveness to subtle cues. But when you commit to nurturing your bond, you'll have a partner beside you through every twist and turn.

## Conclusion
Strong relationships aren't built on shared interests or sexual chemistry - they're forged in the crucible of tough conversations. By having these 5 crucial discussions, you'll create an unshakable foundation for your life together.


When you learn to dive deep together - bringing your whole, imperfect selves and facing your fears hand-in-hand - you won't just make it. You'll thrive, crafting a one-of-a-kind love strong enough to withstand any storm. Have those conversations - your relationship is worth it.
