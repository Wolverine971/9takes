<p class="firstLetter">This is not for people with depression. This is for the person who wants to be there for their friend who has depression.</p>

Ok, in this guide I am going to piece together multiple ideas. Buckle up.

Also I am not an expert.

## Understanding the Depression Loop

People stuck in depression are stuck in a loop.

The loop begins with feeling sad because of some reason and feeling like there is no way out. They could feel sad or depressed for any reason. The reason doesnt matter. What matters is that there is a saddness that wont go away and that is how the loop begins.

Because depressed people don't think there is a way out they don't work to find a way out.

It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. They are stuck in a loop.

So how do you break out of the loop?

**Well first thing that you don't want to do is be happy or offer advice.**

Being happy around a depressed person is a mistake. You will probably just make them feel more depressed. And more isolated.

However here is where the insight is. "Misery loves company." It is a saying for a reason. Why does mysery love company? Because when you are miserable with someone else you feel less miserable. Think Navy seals suffering in BUDs. Yeah it sucks but if you look at the other people its not so bad. You just gotta do better than the other guy. There is more it it but you get it.

Commiserating with someone who feels bad feels good. It feels good to talk about how shitty your life it feel good for someone to understand where you are coming from. Depressed people don't feel like other people understand them. They feel alone. But when you get them talking about their depression it kinda helps. This process is a practical step for showing empathy. It is what naturally empathetic people do. They get on the level of the other person and they enter into their world.

**People who suck at empathy are unable to venture into other people's worlds.** They are too stuck in their own world.

They are talking when they should be listening.

### Part 2 of this.

When you start empathizeing with someone the person you are empathizeing with starts to not feel alone. Then a subtle change takes place.

1. They don't feel alone
2. They start thinking about you and your perspective
3. They start comparing themselves to you and others.

The order of these steps matter. If you try to get someone to understand your perspective while they still feel alone, they are not going to listen to you.

And one step further would be to look at someone who has it worse. You feel slightly better about yourself when you see someone lower on the totem pole.

Another example would be comedy. It is funny when someone gets kicked in the nuts. You feel bad for them but its also hilarious. Its also why commedians dress down

This is why people sometimes put others down - it makes them feel more secure.
The key is to be metaphorically alongside the person with depression, not above them. You need to empathize and feel the depression with them. The "hack" is to first be depressed with the person, or if you're the one struggling, compare yourself to someone worse off, not better. This provides perspective and motivation.

## Identifying the Roots and Patterns Fueling Depression

Depression arises from certain "maladaptive patterns" - unhealthy ways of thinking, behaving, and interacting. Understanding the root causes and recurring cycles that enable depression is crucial for breaking free.

## Unmasking the Facade of Happiness

Many people fake being happy on the outside, while silently struggling with depression or major stress on the inside. Comedians, for example, are often deeply depressed. And a lot of people simply distract themselves from their depression, plastering on a smile.

## Overcoming the Isolation of Depression

A common aspect of depression is feeling utterly alone, like no one can possibly understand. But the reality is there are countless others out there who can relate and empathize.
