# Personality Maxing Blueprint: Revision Notes

_Working notes for rewriting the 90-day-personality-maxing-blueprint blog_

---

## The Problem with the Current Version

The current blueprint jumps straight into tactics without establishing a foundational strategy. It lacks a clear philosophical framework for what "personality maxing" actually means.

---

## The New Framework: 5 Phases

### Phase 1: DEFINE — What Is Personality?

**Core Insight:** Personality, in practice, describes how you are **similar to** and **different from** other people.

The first step to maxing your personality is assessing how you're similar/different from others.

**Exercises:**

1. **Self-Documentation** — Journal or record a video answering:
   - "How am I similar to [specific person]? How am I different?"
   - "How am I similar to most people? How am I different from most people?"

2. **External Perspective** — Ask someone else these same questions about themselves, then compare:
   - How do you view yourself vs. how they view themselves?
   - What does this reveal about your self-perception?

**Output:** A baseline understanding of your perceived uniqueness and commonality.

### Phase 2: DISCOVER — Identifying Your Superpowers

**Core Insight:** The comparison exercise scratches the surface of your superpowers. Now we go deeper using the Enneagram.

**Process:**

1. Introduce the Enneagram as a framework for understanding personality
2. Use the learning framework from `beginners-guide-to-determining-your-enneagram-type`
3. Explore type-based strengths and weaknesses

**Important Note:** Generic type descriptions are just starting points. Your authentic superpowers come from:

- Your unique experiences
- How you grew up
- What you've been through
- What you've learned

The Enneagram prompts discovery—it doesn't define you.

### Phase 3: STRENGTHS — Arrow of Security (Thriving State)

**Core Insight:** Understanding where you go in comfort reveals your highest potential.

**Deep Dive Questions:**

- According to the Enneagram, where does your type go in security?
- What situations make you thrive?
- When you're at your best:
  - What are you **feeling**?
  - What are you **thinking**?
  - What are you **doing**?
- Who are you acting like? What does this version of you look like?

**Goal:** Flesh out the specific conditions and behaviors of your peak state.

---

### Phase 4: WEAKNESSES — Arrow of Stress (Struggling State)

**Core Insight:** Understanding your triggers and stress patterns is therapeutic work.

**Therapeutic Language to Explore:**

- **Triggers** — What causes anxiety, stress, anger, resentment, shame, or insecurity?
- **Patterns** — How do these weaknesses manifest behaviorally?

**Deep Dive Questions (Arrow of Disintegration):**

- Where does your type go under stress?
- When you're at your worst:
  - What are you **feeling**?
  - What are you **thinking**?
  - What are you **doing**?
- Who are you acting like? What does this version of you look like?

**Goal:** Map the emotional and behavioral landscape of your stress responses.

### Phase 5: DEPLOY — From Self-Knowledge to Charisma

**Core Insight:** Now flip the script—apply this understanding to OTHER people.

**The Bridge:**

- Other people are going through the same things
- Their experiences shape their personality
- They have strengths and weaknesses you need to be attuned to

**The Charisma Formula:**

> A charismatic person understands others and understands themselves and is ready for both the good and bad. They are genuine, and genuinely curious about the other people around. They take the time to ask good questions and listen to other people. They know when and where to assert themselves and where and when to be passive and listen.

**Components:**

1. Self-knowledge (Phases 1-4)
2. Genuine curiosity about others
3. Good questions + active listening
4. Knowing when to assert vs. when to listen

_Note: This section needs more layers—what specific skills enable this?_

## Additional Concepts to Develop

### The Archetype Frame

The Enneagram archetype is a helpful but imperfect model:

- **Best Version:** What you could become at your highest
- **Worst Version:** What you could become at your lowest

This creates a spectrum for self-assessment and goal-setting.

### Protocols & Common Sabotages

**Research needed from:**

- Brené Brown — Shame, vulnerability, courage
- Andrew Huberman — Neuroscience of behavior change, stress, dopamine
- Top Enneagram influencers — Growth paths, transformation strategies

---

## The Thesis

> Given that we are all similar and different, we should be genuinely curious about other people. **In order to max out your personality, you need to be genuinely curious about those around you.**

This is the destination. Everything builds to this.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What specific exercises for the comparison phase?
- [ ] How to structure the Enneagram introduction without losing people?
- [ ] What layers need to be added to the charisma section?
- [ ] Which protocols from Brown/Huberman/Enneagram experts are most relevant?
- [ ] How to make the arrow of security content actionable?
- [ ] What's the timeline structure? (Still 90 days? Different phases?)
