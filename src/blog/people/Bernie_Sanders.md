Bernie Sanders is a well-known American politician who has served as a senator for Vermont since 2007. He is also a former candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Through his political career, we can see that he embodies the traits of an Enneagram Type 9.

## Peaceful Mediator

Enneagram Type 9s are known as peacemakers and mediators. They are able to see both sides of an argument and want to create a harmonious environment for everyone. This is evident in Sanders' political beliefs, where he often advocates for policies that benefit everyone, not just a particular group. He has fought for healthcare reform, affordable housing, and workers' rights, all of which are meant to create a fairer and more equal society.

## Avoiding Conflict

One of the core fears of an Enneagram Type 9 is conflict. They often go out of their way to avoid it and maintain a peaceful environment. This is also seen in Sanders' political career, where he has often tried to find common ground with his opponents rather than engaging in heated debates. He has worked with Republicans on issues such as veterans' benefits and infrastructure.

## Focusing on Unity

Enneagram Type 9s are known for their ability to bring people together. They want everyone to feel included and valued, and they work towards this goal. Sanders has also shown this trait through his political career. He has advocated for policies that unite people rather than dividing them. He believes that everyone deserves access to healthcare, education, and other basic needs.

## Strong Sense of Empathy

Another trait of Enneagram Type 9s is their strong sense of empathy. They are able to understand and feel the emotions of others, which helps them connect with people on a deeper level. This is also true for Sanders, who has shown empathy towards those who are struggling. He has spoken out against income inequality, and has called for a fairer economic system that benefits all people, not just the wealthy.
