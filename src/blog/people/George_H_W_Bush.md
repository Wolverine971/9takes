George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, is often described as a loyal and pragmatic leader. These traits are typical of an enneagram type 6, also known as "The Loyalist." In this article, we'll explore why Bush's personality aligns with this type and provide examples from his life.

## Loyalty to Family and Wife
George H.W. Bush was a family man who valued loyalty and commitment above all else. He was married to Barbara Bush for 73 years, and their marriage was widely regarded as a model of devotion and mutual support. This loyalty extended to his children, including George W. Bush, who also served as President of the United States.

## Fear of Weapons of Mass Destruction
As a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), George H.W. Bush had an acute awareness of the potential danger posed by weapons of mass destruction. This fear was evident in his decision to launch Operation Desert Storm, a military campaign aimed at removing Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which had been invaded by Saddam Hussein.

## Worst Fears Coming True on 9/11
As mentioned earlier, enneagram type 6 individuals are often plagued by anxiety and fear. For George H.W. Bush, the events of 9/11 were like a nightmare come true. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon represented a catastrophic failure of the government's ability to protect its citizens, a scenario that had undoubtedly been the subject of many of his worst fears.

## The Patriot Act and Mass Surveillance
In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, George H.W. Bush signed the Patriot Act into law, which greatly expanded the government's ability to conduct surveillance on its citizens. This decision can be seen as a manifestation of the typical enneagram 6 behavior of seeking security through information gathering and analysis.
