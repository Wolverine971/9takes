Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has captivated global audiences since her engagement to Prince Harry and before that on the TV show "Suits". She has been subject to both fascination and intense scrutiny and here we will make the case that Meghan's behavior aligns well with the characteristics of an Enneagram Type 2, also known as The Helper.

## The Desire to be Needed
A defining trait of Enneagram Type 2's is their inherent need to be indispensable. This drive often fuels their philanthropic endeavors and their engagement in societal change. Meghan's career trajectory and advocacy work seem to reflect this pattern. For instance, her involvement in women's rights and other charitable causes, including her role as a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, suggest an intrinsic need to be helpful and to make a tangible difference.

## Keeping Up Appearances
Ever notice how Meghan always seems to have a grip on her narrative? Type 2's are known to subtly control the narrative, ensuring they remain in the best light possible.

Type 2's also exhibit a tendency to manage the narrative surrounding their lives, a trait typically associated with maintaining a positive image. Meghan's efforts to control her public image, including her reported involvement in the book "Finding Freedom", align with this trait. Her careful management of media appearances and interviews, both before and after her royal union, further underscores this tendency.



## A Royal Drama, or a Plea for Sympathy?
Another common trait among Type 2's is a penchant for invoking drama to gain attention. At times, they may portray themselves as victims in a bid to elicit empathy. Meghan's dynamic relationship with the royal family seems to reflect this trait. Critics argue that her decision to step back from royal duties, coupled with the explosive revelations in her interview with Oprah Winfrey, were strategic moves to control the narrative and garner sympathy.

## Expressing Empathy and Warmth
Lastly, Type 2's are often praised for their warmth and empathy, traits that Meghan has consistently displayed. She is known for her genuine rapport with people and her willingness to leverage her platform to discuss sensitive topics. Her candid essay about her experience with miscarriage, aimed at normalizing conversations around this issue, underscores her empathetic nature.
