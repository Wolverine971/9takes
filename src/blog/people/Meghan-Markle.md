Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has captivated global audiences since her engagement to Prince Harry and before that on the TV show "Suits". She has been subject to both fascination and intense scrutiny and here we will make the case that Meghan's displays characteristics of an Enneagram Type 2, also known as The Helper.

## The Desire to be Needed

A defining trait of Enneagram Type 2's is their inherent need to be indispensable. This drive often fuels their philanthropic endeavors and their engagement in societal change. When people need help, twos are ready to jump in and Meghan's career trajectory and advocacy work seem to reflect this pattern. For instance, her involvement in women's rights and other charitable causes, including her role as a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, suggest an intrinsic need to be helpful and to make a tangible difference.

This also helps explain the motivation to leave the Royal Family. The Royal Family did not need Meghan which probably rubbed her the wrong way which encouraged her to go someplace where she was needed.

## Keeping Up Appearances

Type 2's have a deep desire to feel love and are willing to twist narratives and details to make themselves appear worthy of sympathy and love. Meghan seems to be very aware of how she is perceived and has put forth multiple efforts to control her public image. When she and her husband Prince Harry were preparing to leave the royal family and they were planning their exit. But to appear strategic would not play well with the narrative of being outcast by the royal family.

## Expressing Empathy and Warmth

On the positive side type 2's are often praised for their warmth and empathy. Meghan does have a warm smile and has the ability to make you feel like the best thing since sliced bread. Or as the kids say she can make you feel like your shii be bussin respectively. Twos can build genuine rapport with people quickly and one can tell there was an element to this in her and Prince Harry's quick and whirlwind romance. It is likely that she displayed empathy for the Prince and this was something that drew Harry towards her and that he reciprocated for her when she started getting criticized.
