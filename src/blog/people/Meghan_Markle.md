Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been in the public eye for years. Since her engagement to Prince Harry and subsequent marriage, she has been a subject of fascination, scrutiny, and controversy. As an enneagram expert, I believe that Meghan Markle's personality type is Enneagram Type 2 - The Helper. Here are four reasons why:

## Needing to be needed

Type 2's are known for their need to be needed. They often derive a sense of self-worth from helping others and making a difference in their lives. Meghan's philanthropic work and advocacy for women's rights are examples of this. She also became very involved in the charity sector and was a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada before marrying into the royal family.

## Control of the narrative

Type 2's also have a tendency to control the narrative, to make sure they are seen in a positive light. Meghan Markle has been known to go to great lengths to control her public image, such as her involvement in the book "Finding Freedom." She also reportedly had a lot of control over her media appearances and interviews before and after her marriage.

## Drama and victimhood

Type 2's have a tendency to bring up drama to get attention, and they may also play the victim to receive sympathy. Meghan Markle has been accused of doing just that with her relationship with the royal family. She and Prince Harry's decision to step back as senior members of the royal family, as well as their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, were seen by some as attempts to gain sympathy and control the narrative.

## Empathy and warmth

One positive aspect of being a Type 2 is that they are often warm and empathetic. Meghan Markle has been described as having a genuine warmth and connection with people. She has also used her platform to speak up for important causes, such as her essay on the loss of her pregnancy and the importance of normalizing conversations around miscarriage.
