Nancy Reagan, the First Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989, is often remembered for her stylish fashion sense and her advocacy for the "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign. However, when looking at her life through the lens of the Enneagram personality system, it becomes clear that she was an Enneagram Type 2, the Helper.

## Nancy Reagan was fiercely devoted to her husband.

Enneagram Type 2s are known for their intense focus on relationships, particularly their primary romantic relationships. Nancy Reagan was famously devoted to her husband, President Ronald Reagan, throughout their 52-year marriage. She was known for her protective instincts towards him, often taking charge of his schedule and fiercely guarding his privacy. This intense focus on her husband is a classic example of Type 2 behavior.

## She prioritized the needs of others.

Another hallmark of Enneagram Type 2s is their tendency to prioritize the needs of others over their own. Nancy Reagan was known for her advocacy work, particularly for her work on drug prevention and treatment. She saw this work as a way to help others, even when it was politically controversial. She also prioritized the needs of her husband, often putting his needs before her own.

## She was often described as warm and welcoming.

Type 2s are often described as warm and welcoming, and this was certainly true of Nancy Reagan. She was known for her graciousness and kindness, particularly towards guests at the White House. She was also known for her sense of humor and her ability to put people at ease. These qualities are all hallmarks of the Helper personality type.

## She had a strong sense of duty and responsibility.

Enneagram Type 2s are often motivated by a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards others. Nancy Reagan was no exception. She saw her role as First Lady as an opportunity to serve others, particularly in her advocacy work. She also felt a strong sense of responsibility towards her husband, particularly as his health began to decline in his later years. Her dedication to her husband and her advocacy work are both examples of this sense of duty and responsibility.
