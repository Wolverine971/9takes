Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, is often described as a calm and easy-going leader. This demeanor is often associated with Enneagram Type 9, known as the "Peacemaker." In this blog post, we will explore why Ronald Reagan is an Enneagram Type 9 and provide examples from his life.

## Desire for peace and harmony
Enneagram Type 9s value peace and harmony above all else, and this is evident in Reagan's leadership. He was known for his ability to bring people together and find common ground. In his first inaugural address, he famously said, "We must all learn to live together as brothers or we will all perish together as fools."

## Avoidance of conflict
Type 9s have a strong aversion to conflict and seek to avoid it whenever possible. Reagan's avoidance of conflict was often seen as a weakness by his opponents, but he viewed it as a strength. He once said, "Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means."

## Calm under pressure
Type 9s are known for their calm demeanor and ability to remain composed under pressure. Reagan demonstrated this trait during the assassination attempt on his life in 1981. Despite being shot and seriously wounded, he remained calm and even made jokes with the medical staff in the hospital.

## Emphasis on unity
Enneagram Type 9s place a high value on unity and often seek to create a sense of oneness among people. Reagan's "Morning in America" campaign was a prime example of this. He emphasized the idea of Americans working together towards a common goal and painted a positive vision for the future.
