> **Disclaimer** This analysis of Emily Ratajkowski's Enneagram type is speculative, based on publicly available information, and may not reflect the actual personality type of Emily.

<p class="firstLetter">Emily Ratajkowski has been in the public eye for years as a model, actress, and author.</p>

For those who are paying attention, they know that she pushes boundaries and is all about challenging societal norms. Her unapologetic embrace of her sexuality, keen awareness of power dynamics, and support for underdogs and outcasts align with the characteristics of an Enneagram Type 8, also known as The Challenger.

## Owning and Embracing Her Sexuality

A defining characteristic of [Type 8 individuals](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-8) is their boldness and willingness to assert themselves.

Ratajkowski embodies this trait by confidently owning her sexuality and embracing her body. From her breakout role in the "Blurred Lines" music video to her modeling work and advocacy for body positivity, she has consistently defied expectations and championed a more inclusive and empowering approach to women's bodies. She has also flat-out said multiple times that she likes sex.

## Navigating Emasculation

Type 8 individuals are known for their strength, resilience, and independence, qualities that may at times lead to <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.laineygossip.com/emily-ratajkowski-on-money-power-men-being-emasculated-by-confident-successful-women/73298">feelings of emasculation in others</a>. Ratajkowski is no stranger to this phenomenon, as she has discussed men feeling emasculated by her in various interviews. By acknowledging this issue and continuing to assert her power and autonomy, Ratajkowski exemplifies the resilience and self-assuredness characteristic of Enneagram 8s.

## Awareness of Power Dynamics

As an Enneagram Type 8, Ratajkowski's keen understanding of power dynamics in the modeling and entertainment industries is no surprise. In her book "<a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250817860/mybody">My Body</a>," she discusses issues related to consent, exploitation, and the male gaze, demonstrating her ability to confront and challenge the imbalances that exist within these industries. This awareness of power dynamics and the desire to challenge them is a hallmark of the Type 8 personality.

## Supporting the Underdog and Amplifying the Voices of Outcasts

Ratajkowski has used her platform to amplify the voices of those who have faced challenges and judgment in the public eye.
