## Living in the Shadow of Uncertainty

Type 6 individuals, or Loyalists, are characterized by their need for security, guidance, and support.

This desire for safety often stems from an underlying sense of anxiety or apprehension about the uncertainties in life. It's easy to overlook this aspect of Khlo√©'s personality when one only focuses on her seemingly unflappable exterior. However, beneath that tough demeanor, Khlo√© often exhibits signs of anxiety and apprehension, which align with a [Type 6](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-6) personality.

One of the most prominent examples of Khlo√©'s Type 6 tendencies emerged during her tumultuous marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom. Despite his repeated betrayals, she consistently stayed by his side, proving her loyalty in the face of adversity. Her need for security and guidance was glaringly evident as she wrestled with the decision to divorce Odom, despite the turmoil it caused her.

## Seeking Guidance in Relationships

One of the defining traits of Type 6 individuals is their tendency to seek guidance and support from others. This often manifests in their relationships. For Khlo√©, her relationships, particularly with her sisters Kim, <a href="/personality-analysis/Kylie-Jenner" >Kylie</a>, and <a href="/personality-analysis/Kourtney-Kardashian" >Kourtney</a>, play a pivotal role in her life. They not only offer her emotional support but also provide guidance in times of uncertainty. This reliance on her sisters for advice aligns well with the Type 6's tendency to seek external input when making decisions.

Consider her relationship with sister <a href="/personality-analysis/Kim-Kardashian" >Kim Kardashian</a>, who Khlo√© often turns to for advice and support, especially during difficult periods. Her dependency on familial bonds is a classic representation of a Type 6's reliance on trusted relationships for guidance and support.

Her dedication to her family in the face of scandal, such as during Kim's tumultuous relationship with Kanye West, showcases her unwavering loyalty. Even in her relationships, Khlo√©'s loyalty often takes precedence over her personal happiness.

Amidst the Tristan Thompson cheating scandal, Khlo√© stood by him, even while dealing with public ridicule.
