<p class="firstLetter">Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him.</p>

Pete Davidsonâ€”SNL alum, tabloid regular, and serial celebrity-daterâ€”has carved out a bizarre niche in pop culture. His tattooed frame and dead-eyed charm have landed him in Hollywood films, comedy specials, and the beds of some of the world's most famous women.

But beneath the chaos? A classic Type 9 personalityâ€”The Peacemakerâ€”just trying to find some damn calm in the storm.

<li><b>The Anger Underneath</b>: Behind that sleepy-eyed grin hides suppressed rageâ€”a quintessential Type 9 trait. It surfaces in biting comedy about Staten Island, celebrity culture, and his own mental health struggles.

## Self-Deprecating Comedy: Type 9's Ultimate Defense Mechanism

Nothing screams Type 9 louder than Davidson's signature self-roasting.

Behind every joke about his "butthole eyes" or "mentally ill looks" lies a classic Peacemaker strategyâ€”diffuse tension before it arrives. When his engagement to Ariana Grande imploded in public, he didn't hide. He joked about it on Weekend Update. When people questioned his BDE (Big Dick Energy), he leaned in harder.

Why? Because [Type 9s](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-9) will do _anything_ to maintain inner peaceâ€”even if it means beating others to the punch.

Born in Staten Island and shaped by tragedy (his firefighter father died in the 9/11 attacks), Davidson learned early that humor creates emotional buffers. It's not just funnyâ€”it's survival.

## The Rage Behind the Glazed Eyes: A Type 9's Hidden Fire

Look closely at Davidson's deadpan delivery. There's something simmering underneath.

That's repressed angerâ€”the Type 9's dirty little secret.

While Peacemakers appear chill and conflict-avoidant, they're actually sitting on volcanic rage. Davidson lets it seep through in calculated doses:

- His brutal takedowns of his hometown Staten Island
- Those cutting remarks about Kanye during the Kardashian drama
- The barely contained frustration when discussing mental health stigma

One moment from his Netflix special perfectly captures this duality. Davidson calmly discusses internet trolls telling him to kill himselfâ€”before suddenly unleashing a vicious, precise counterattack. Classic Nine: peaceful until pushed beyond the breaking point.

## The Relationship Shapeshifter: Why Pete Becomes His Partners

Let's talk about that dating history.

From [Ariana Grande](/personality-analysis/Ariana-Grande) to Kate Beckinsale to [Kim Kardashian](/personality-analysis/Kim-Kardashian), Davidson doesn't just date womenâ€”he absorbs their identities. With Grande, he collected tattoos of her lyrics and became her biggest public cheerleader. With Kardashian, he suddenly showed up in Skims underwear and bleached blonde hair.

This isn't calculated celebrity climbing. It's pure Type 9 merger.

Nines instinctively blend with their partners' identities because their own sense of self can feel hazy. They're natural adaptorsâ€”finding peace by becoming whatever their partner needs.

His 2022 Kardashian-influenced style transformation wasn't fake. It was a Type 9 finding temporary identity through connection. No wonder he falls hard and fast.

## Mental Health, Substances, and the Search for Peace

Davidson's openness about borderline personality disorder, depression, and his marijuana use isn't just refreshing celebrity candor.

It's a Type 9 desperately trying to find equilibrium.

The trademark Nine motivationâ€”achieving inner peaceâ€”explains Davidson's entire approach to wellness. His rotating cocktail of treatments, substances, and lifestyle changes represent a restless search for stability.

His sobriety attempts. The ketamine treatments. The constant self-reflection in his comedy. Each is a chapter in a Type 9's quest for authentic peace rather than the numbing "peace" of disengagement that unhealthy Nines often settle for.

## The Paradox of Success: How a Type 9 Built an Empire Through Discomfort

Davidson's estimated net worth exceeds $8 million. His resume includes blockbuster films and Netflix specials. He dated some of the world's most beautiful women.

Not bad for a personality type known for inaction and conflict avoidance.

This success emerged precisely because Davidson channeled his Nine-ness productively. His laid-back authenticity resonates with audiences tired of polished celebrity perfection. His vulnerabilityâ€”rooted in Type 9's capacity for emotional depthâ€”creates genuine connection through comedy.

Most importantly, he's learned to use his personality rather than fight it. When Kim Kardashian called him "the sweetest, most thoughtful person," she was describing classical Nine traits that, when healthy, create magnetic charm.
