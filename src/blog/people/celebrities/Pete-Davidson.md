## The Nine's Humor: A Tool for Inner Peace

One trademark characteristic of Type 9 is the pursuit of inner peace and Davidson seems to encapsulate this through his own unique style of humor. Known for his self-deprecating jokes, Davidson has been seen time and again using comedy to process his emotions. This was evident when he addressed the highly-publicized and somewhat contentious end of his relationship with <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Ariana-Grande" >Ariana Grande</a> during a stand-up gig. Instead of shying away from the subject, he joked about it, masterfully diffusing tension and embracing a form of inner tranquility.

Where is Pete Davidson from, you ask? Staten Island, New York. The loss of his firefighter father in the 9/11 attacks is a topic he's broached repeatedly in his stand-up routines, drawing on dark humor to help himself and others cope with the tragedy.

## Unresolved Anger: The Nines' Inner World

Delving further into Davidson's jokes, one can glimpse an undercurrent of unresolved anger. A classic Type 9 trait, suppressed anger often lurks beneath the calm exterior. Notable instances can be found in Davidson's humor - where he occasionally allows this anger to surface, masked by his comedic talent. Whether it's roasting the affluent residents of Staten Island or expressing frustration with the constant media attention surrounding his relationships, his unique brand of comedy may indeed provide a channel for these deeper emotional currents.

## Merging and Mirroring: Nines in Relationships

Pete Davidson's dating history also paints a picture of a Type 9 personality. Nines are known to merge with their partner's identity, often mirroring their interests and adopting their views. When Davidson dated Ariana Grande, he was frequently seen supporting her at concerts and gushing about her on talk shows. More recently, his relationship with <a href="./Kim-Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> has seen him drawn into a world far from his Staten Island roots, often photographed in the stylish ensembles that Kardashian's circle is known for. Through each of these high-profile relationships 💑, Davidson demonstrates the Type 9's tendency to align with their partner's persona.

## The Nine's Path: Seeking Peace amid Chaos

The famous Peacemaker, however, doesn't always live a peaceful life. The comedian's battle with mental health and his decision to become sober 🚫🥤 are public knowledge, presenting a stark contrast to his life in the fast-paced world of comedy and entertainment. Yet, Davidson's candidness about his struggles and his decision to prioritize his mental health aligns with the Type 9's desire for inner peace.

Viewed through this lens, his multitude of tattoos, often a subject of public fascination, could be seen as his form of self-expression or a physical manifestation of the inner chaos that he seeks to placate.
