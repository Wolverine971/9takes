## What Makes Alex Cooper Tick? Uncovering Her Personality Type

With her boundless energy, rapid-fire speech, and insatiable curiosity, Alex Cooper radiates Enneagram Type 7 energy – ["The Enthusiast."](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7)

Spotify's second-highest-paid podcaster (behind only Joe Rogan) didn't get there by accident. Her Type 7 traits have been the rocket fuel propelling her meteoric rise.

### Hallmarks of an Enneagram Type 7 Personality

Type 7s are the ultimate experience-seekers. These vibrant souls chase novelty and stimulation, diving headfirst into new adventures while skillfully avoiding pain or discomfort.

They're typically:

- Optimistic and resilient
- Quick-thinking and adaptable
- Charming and socially magnetic
- Entrepreneurial and opportunity-focused
- Resistant to limitations or confinement

Sound familiar? Alex Cooper embodies these traits in everything from her business decisions to her interview style.

## The Making of a Media Mogul: Alex Cooper's Journey

### From Soccer Fields to Studio Microphones

Born August 21, 1994, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, Alex's competitive drive emerged early.

Her father, a former hockey player for the University of Wisconsin turned TV sports producer, instilled that athletic spirit. Her mother, a psychologist, perhaps unwittingly contributed to Alex's natural ability to get people talking about their innermost thoughts and feelings.

Alex earned a Division I soccer scholarship to Boston University, making 49 appearances and scoring one goal for the Terriers from 2013 to 2015. This athletic background explains both her disciplined work ethic and her comfort with locker-room talk.

</div>

After graduating from BU's College of Communication in 2017, Alex moved to New York City, working in advertising sales while dreaming of something bigger. Her first taste of media came as an anchor for Dirty Water Media in 2016, where she began developing her on-camera charisma.

But it wasn't until 2018 that Alex would find her true calling.

### From "Gluck Gluck 9000" to "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters"

In 2018, Alex and Sofia Franklyn launched "Call Her Daddy," initially recording in their New York apartment.

The podcast exploded almost overnight – growing from 12,000 to 2 million downloads in just two months. Barstool Sports quickly acquired the show, sensing its massive potential.

The early "Call Her Daddy" episodes were raw, raunchy, and revolutionary. Alex and Sofia flipped the script on sex talk, giving women permission to be just as bold and unapologetic as men had always been. The infamous "Gluck Gluck 9000" episode became the stuff of legend.

This willingness to venture where others wouldn't dare is quintessential Type 7 behavior – pushing boundaries while making it seem effortless and fun.

When the infamous "Daddy Divorce" happened in 2020 (with Sofia departing amid contract disputes), Alex showcased another Type 7 superpower: adaptability. Rather than crumbling, she pivoted, taking full creative control and evolving the show beyond its initial formula.

Today's "Call Her Daddy" features intimate conversations with celebrities like Miley Cyrus, Hailey Bieber, and even Vice President Kamala Harris. Rolling Stone even dubbed Alex "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters" – a testament to her growth from shock jock to skilled interviewer.

This evolution parallels the Type 7's growth journey – from seeking surface-level excitement to developing deeper substance without losing that essential spark.

### Building The Unwell Empire

Alex's ambitions extend far beyond her own podcast.

In 2021, she secured a $60 million, three-year exclusive deal with Spotify – making her their highest-paid female podcaster. By August 2024, she'd upgraded to a staggering $125 million deal with SiriusXM.

September 2023 saw the launch of The Unwell Network, partnering with Spotify's Megaphone to sign emerging voices like TikTok sensation Alix Earle ("Hot Mess") and British creator Madeline Argy ("Pretty Lonesome"). Both podcasts immediately dominated the charts.

Not content with audio domination, Alex expanded into beverages with Unwell Hydration in November 2024, debuting at Target stores nationwide in January 2025 with flavors like Strawberry and Mango Citrus.

This constant expansion into new territories is classic Type 7 behavior – always seeking the next horizon, building a life full of variety and stimulation.

## Behind the Scenes: The Inner World of Alex Cooper

### Chasing Fulfillment, Avoiding Pain

Type 7s are driven by a core fear of being trapped, limited, or experiencing emotional pain. Their core desire is for freedom, happiness, and exciting experiences.

For Alex, this manifests in her relentless pursuit of new projects and opportunities. Her workdays likely involve podcast preparation, business strategy for The Unwell Network, social media engagement with the "Daddy Gang," and planning for future ventures.

Even her approach to wellness reflects this Type 7 flexibility. In a revealing interview with People magazine, Alex shared that her health routine changes daily – sometimes focused on fitness and hydration, other times much less structured.

Her most famous wellness quirk? She doesn't wash her face – preferring toners like Paula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Toner instead. This unconventional approach perfectly captures her resistance to rigid routines.

### The Private Alex: Beyond the Microphone

While she broadcasts intimate details to millions, Alex maintains surprising boundaries around her personal life.

Her relationship with film producer Matt Kaplan (founder of ACE Entertainment, known for "To All the Boys I've Loved Before") began with a Zoom business meeting in July 2020. Their April 2024 wedding in Riviera Maya, Mexico marked a new chapter for the podcaster.

Alex is also a devoted dog mom, sharing her life with her own pup and Kaplan's dog – evidence of her nurturing side beneath the provocative persona.

As a Type 7, Alex likely processes the world through a lens of possibilities rather than problems. When facing challenges, she instinctively looks for silver linings and escape routes rather than dwelling in discomfort – explaining her resilience through public controversies.

## Navigating Storms: How Type 7 Traits Carried Alex Through Controversies

### The "Daddy Divorce" That Could Have Ended Everything

The 2020 split with Sofia Franklyn could have derailed Alex's career entirely. Instead, it showcased her Type 7 strengths.

When negotiations with Barstool Sports turned contentious, Alex demonstrated remarkable adaptability. Rather than remaining locked in conflict, she negotiated directly with Barstool founder Dave Portnoy, securing creative control and favorable terms.

In her first solo episode, titled "The Funeral," Alex exhibited the Type 7's gift for reframing challenges as opportunities. She transparently shared her side of the story while charting an exciting path forward – turning potential disaster into a career-defining moment.

This resilience in crisis is textbook Type 7 behavior. When faced with painful situations, they instinctively seek escape routes and fresh perspectives rather than ruminating on what's lost.

### Growth Through Challenge

Alex has faced criticism for controversial interviews and content choices throughout her career. Yet these experiences have seemingly pushed her toward greater depth and reflection – signs of a maturing Type 7.

Her podcast now regularly explores mental health, with Alex openly discussing her anxiety struggles. This vulnerability represents significant growth for a personality type typically avoidant of pain or discomfort.

This evolution mirrors the Type 7's growth journey toward their "security point" (Type 5), developing greater thoughtfulness and introspection while maintaining their essential enthusiasm.

## The Cultural Impact: Why People Can't Get Enough of Alex Cooper

### Creating a Movement, Not Just a Podcast

The "Daddy Gang" isn't just an audience – it's a cultural phenomenon.

Alex has masterfully created a community around her show, with 4.4 million Spotify followers making it the second most popular podcast globally in 2024. This connection explains her unprecedented leverage in business negotiations.

Her Type 7 enthusiasm is contagious, drawing listeners into her world and making them feel part of something bigger. This magnetic quality explains how she's transformed casual listeners into devoted fans who follow her across platforms and ventures.

### Redefining Female Empowerment

Perhaps Alex's most significant cultural impact has been normalizing women's candid conversations about sex, relationships, and ambition.

While early episodes focused on sexual empowerment, today's "Call Her Daddy" tackles everything from mental health stigmas to business strategies. This evolution mirrors Alex's own growth – and has brought her audience along for the journey.

By sharing her business successes transparently, Alex has inspired countless women to pursue their own entrepreneurial dreams. Her $125 million SiriusXM deal sent a powerful message about women's value in digital media.

This mission-driven approach reveals the depth beneath the Type 7's playful exterior – using their gifts for meaningful impact rather than mere entertainment.
