## What is Alex Cooper's Personality Type?

With her zest for life and insatiable curiosity, Alex seems to give off Enneagram Type 7 energy, known as "The Enthusiast."

### Characteristics of Enneagram Type 7

Type 7 individuals are extroverted, optimistic, and spontaneous. They are the life of the party and are always seeking new experiences. However, their constant search for excitement can sometimes lead them to avoid facing their inner fears and anxieties.

## Why Alex Cooper Could Be a Type 7

### A Life in the Spotlight

Alex was born on August 21, 1994, in Newtown, Pennsylvania. She was active in sports and even received a scholarship to Boston University for women's soccer. Her father was a former hockey player and he had a big influence on her competitive and adventurous spirit.

</div>

Alex's first media job was as an anchor for Dirty Water Media in 2016. And there she started to learn the ins and out of media and how to grab attention.

### The Adventurous Podcaster: A Glimpse into Alex Cooper's World

Alex was destined to start a podcast.

With Sofia Franklyn in 2018 she started "Call Her Daddy." This is when a big chunk of the world got exposed to Alex's personality.

Initially the podcast was focused on relationships and sex, but overtime the show has evolved to cover a broad spectrum of topics. These topics include everything from celebrity gossip to women's rights and mental health. Alex went and continues to go anywhere she pleases and has built a loyal following. The "daddy gang" will go with her no matter the platform.

After some ups and downs she secured a $60 million deal with Spotify.

She was labeled the female <a href="/personality-analysis/Joe-Rogan">Joe Rogan</a>, and the label fit. Alex she split from her partner (more on that below) and started to fly solo. She still aims to inspire her audience by sharing personal stories and advice but her tone has matured. She isn't focused on sex anymore. She went from talking about the gluck gluck 9000 ðŸ˜‰ to doing interviews with celebrities and exploring controversial topics of a different nature.

She is adapting and evolving, which also mirrors the characteristics of Type 7, who is always looking for the next exciting venture.

Beyond the podcast, Alex has also launched <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/unwell/" >The Unwell Network</a>, collaborating with content creators across various mediums like pop-culture and fashion. This initiative further underscores her adventurous spirit.

<!-- In essence, "Call Her Daddy" mirrors Alex's personalityâ€”adventurous, open, and ever-evolving. It's not just a podcast; it's a journey into the world of an Enneagram Type 7, a world filled with endless possibilities. -->

### Handling Controversies with Optimism

Alex is no stranger to drama.

Cooper has faced several controversies, most notably her public feud with former co-host Sofia Franklyn and disputes with Barstool Sports. Whatever happened behind the scenes was over shadowed by **Alex's blend of transparency, strategic decision-making, and optimism**.

She took to her platform to openly discuss the issues, providing her side of the story. She sought to maintain a connection with her audience. This transparency helped her gain public support, turning potential setbacks into opportunities for growth. Alex was also able to negotiate a new contract with Barstool Sports that gave her complete creative control, turning a contentious situation into a win.

She handled the situation with grace and in many people's eyes came out on top.

Her optimistic outlook has been a critical factor in navigating these challenges and that is a hallmark of the Enneagram 7 personality type.

### The Social Butterfly

Alex is more than just a podcaster; she's a social butterfly who brings the energy ðŸ¦‹.

Enneagram Type 7 personalities are known for being extroverted and enthusiastic. Alex's podcast delves into personal stories, controversial topics, and gossip. And Alex eats it up and then some!

Her social reach extends to friendships with celebrities like <a href="/personality-analysis/Miley-Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href="/personality-analysis/Emily-Ratajkowski">Emily Ratajkowski</a>. In a podcast episode with Emily, Alex discusses her image, her relationship with sex, and her decision to tackle political issues. Though she can be bubbly she can also go deep.
