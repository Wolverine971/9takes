It's captivating not just what he shows but how he shows it. His trademark sunglasses, for example, are more than a fashion statement. Neistat uses them to connect directly with his audience, making viewers feel like he's looking right at them. It’s a clever trick, making us think that Casey, much like a consummate Enneagram 4, is constantly aware of his surroundings, giving us a sense of his deep desire to understand and be understood.
