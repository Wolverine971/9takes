## What is Dave Portnoy's Personality Type?

The Enneagram Type 8 is often described as self-confident, decisive, and willful. They are natural leaders who are not afraid to stand alone and often fear being controlled by others. Does that sound like someone we know? Yes, it's Dave Portnoy.

## Why Dave Portnoy Could Be a Type 8

### Portnoy's Business Acumen

Dave Portnoy is in a league of his own regarding business IQ. He wheels and deals like an old-school mobster boss. His pride and joy, Barstool Sports, serves as a case study. Founded in 2003 as a print publication, Barstool transitioned into a digital platform under Portnoy's leadership, eventually becoming a cultural phenomenon. Portnoy pivoted multiple times to keep Barstool relevant while remaining true to its fans. This adaptability showcases his decisive nature, a defining trait of a Type 8 personality.

What truly sets Portnoy apart is what happened in 2020. He sold a majority stake in Barstool Sports to Penn National Gaming in January 2020 for a reported $450 million. Barstool was the same with Portnoy at the helm, and in 2023, Portnoy bought it back- for $1. This was a power move that again showed Portnoy's savvy.

### Marching to His Own Beat: The BFFs Podcast and Celebrity Connections

Dave Portnoy's BFFs podcast with <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/JoshRichards">Josh Richards</a> and <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/bchickenfry">Bri Chickenfry</a> isn't just another podcast; it vividly illustrates his non-conformist approach to life. Whether it's his choice of co-hosts or his friendships with well-known figures like <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Logan-Paul">Logan Paul</a> and <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Jake-Paul">Jake Paul</a>, Portnoy defies societal norms and popular opinions at every turn.

He's friends with the Gen Z TikTokers, and he's also unapologetically a stan of both <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Taylor-Swift">Taylor Swift</a>and Dixie D'Amelio. Public figures often stick to their lanes, but Portnoy makes and sets his lanes. He does what he finds interesting and will be friends with whomever he chooses, regardless of what others might think.

This disregard for societal expectations and his willingness to forge his path symbolizes a Type 8 personality—someone who values control over their own life and is unafraid to stand alone.

### The Controversies

Dave Portnoy has been at the center of a few controversies. However, Dave's approach to handling these situations differs from that of most celebrities. While many public figures might issue a carefully worded apology or sidestep the issue, Portnoy faces it head-on.

Barstool has been accused of being misogynistic multiple times. However, Portnoy doesn't come down and say that he will do better. Instead, he goes on the offense and points out that Barstool has a female CEO and multiple female employees who have gone on to start their own shows and podcasts. If Barstool was misogynistic, then women would not be killing it like they are at Barstool.

“If you want to hate us, go ahead, but we're not going to change who we are.” - El Presidente.

Similarly, when accusations arose about promoting a toxic work culture, Portnoy took to social media to say, “If you work for us and you're not happy, you're free to leave. I'm not holding anyone hostage.” This wasn't an attempt to silence critics but a declaration that he would not be bullied by controversies or slander.

Portnoy's approach to controversies isn't about appeasing the masses; it's about standing his ground and doing what he believes is just. He doesn't allow public opinion to bully him into submission. Instead, he writes his own story.

In the context of the Enneagram, this approach to controversies is typical of a Type 8 personality. 8s are known for their aggressive nature. They need to control their destiny and are always ready for a fight.

## The Art of Revenge: Dave Portnoy's Champagne Ritual

One aspect of Enneagram 8s is that they are fixated on revenge. Revenge might sound like a strong word, but in the world of Type 8s, it's not about malice but justice. Portnoy considers himself the underdog and keeps track of his doubters and haters. Portnoy has a collection of champagne bottles dedicated to his enemies, and he pops them open whenever one faces a downfall.

### A Symbolic Gesture

<!-- Dedicating champagne bottles to his enemies is not just a quirky habit; it's a symbolic gesture. It shows a man who values victory and justice, even if served cold.  -->

This ritual aligns perfectly with the characteristics of Type 8, who often seeks to correct the record and root out injustice. Dave keeps his how scorecard and is willing to wait for his enemies to face the music. When that music finally plays, Dave is ready with a bottle of champagne.

Dave has always been a fan of Taylor Swift. He followed Taylor and <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Kanye">Kanye's</a> drama, where Kanye had a lyric about Taylor, saying, "I made that bitch famous." Taylor said she never knew about or agreed to that Lyric. However, <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Kim-Kardashian" >Kim Kardashian</a> and Kanye released a recording of Taylor green-lighting that part. Later, it came to light that Taylor's recording was edited and was **fake**. Dave knows what it is like to be unfairly slandered, and he doesn't like it. You can bet he has a bottle dedicated to Kim and Kanye.

</div>

### The public display as a reminder

It is a strategic move to share these champagne-popping moments on social media. It turns a personal ritual into a public display. This act serves a dual purpose: it rallies his supporters and sends a message to his enemies. Dave is a natural leader who is unafraid to stand alone and not afraid to display his raw emotions. It's a window into the complex psyche of a man who could be an Enneagram Type 8, driven by a need for control, a thirst for justice, and an unyielding will to stand his ground.

## Wrapping It Up: The Man Behind the Millions and the Pizza Reviews

Dave Portnoy is a man of contrasts. He can do whatever he wants with a net worth of around $120 million. Yet, he does his pizza reviews almost every day. Why? Because he is a man of the people.
