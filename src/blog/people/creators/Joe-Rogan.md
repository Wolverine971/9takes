## What is Joe Rogan's Personality Type?

### Joe Rogan is an Enneagram Type 8

Type 8s, known as The Challengers, are characterized by their desire to assert dominance and control their environment. They seek to protect themselves by gathering strength. This strength can be in the form of physical strength, wealth, power, or even wisdom. They do because somewhere in their childhood, they received the message that it was not ok to be weak. Often, 8s can remember a time when they were vulnerable and taken advantage of. So, the typical 8s coping mechanism is to armor up and remove any perceived vulnerabilities.

They are natural leaders characterized by self-confidence, resilience, and a direct approach to life. 8s have been known to unintentionally intimidate others. They also tend to confront life head-on and are always up to a challenge. Fear is not a factor for 8s 😉.

Rogan epitomizes this type. He has had multiple careers, from stand-up comedian to UFC commentator, Fear Factor host, and host of the most popular podcast in the world, the Joe Rogan Experience. Most people only attempt to do some of the things Joe has done. But Joe likes a challenge. Joe is an 8, and he knows that every challenge he faces only makes him stronger.

## Characteristics of Joe Rogan that align with Type 8

### Direct yet open

Rogan is assertive and direct. When outsiders comment on Rogan's podcast, they marvel at how nonchalant and unrefined he is. Joe can talk this way because he is not hiding anything. Joe approaches life with a brash honesty that he uses to get to the root of the matter. It is both disarming and refreshing, and it makes the people he interviews feel like Joe is an open book, so they become an open book. For example, when he interviewed <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Elon-Musk" >Elon Musk</a>, he was so chill that Elon felt comfortable smoking a joint.

<!-- He does not mince words when discussing complex issues with guests, even guests like -->

<!-- This openness to life born out of a feeling of being untouchable creates a sense of comfort and helps people relax and be honest on his podcast, as seen in the iconic moment where he gets Elon to smoke a joint. -->

 <!-- or exchanging barbs with Dana White in a UFC commentary. This outspoken nature is a crucial feature of the Type 8 personality. -->

 <!-- Joe Rogan helping his friends -->

### Joe Rogan helps his friends

One thing about 8s is that when they are doing good or are in "security," they act like Enneagram 2s, which are known as "the helpers." Many of Rogan's friends talk about Rogan being a good friend. They talk about him giving gifts and genuinely being happy when they succeed. Rogan is not a zero-sum kind of person. He genuinely cares about his friends.

<div class="iframe-container">
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/en4EJ_ocOqk?si=1UkTEJmk1HU5W9bC&amp;start=225" title="Elon Musk and Joe Rogan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 </div>

Another name for Enneagram 8s is the "protector." Joe helping his friends can also be seen as protecting what he cares about. Many of Rogan's friends have been in bad situations, and Rogan has helped them. This is a testament to his character and aligns with him being an Enneagram 8.

### Defying Conventions

Type 8s often defy conventions; if that's not Joe, then I don't know what is. He invites guests from all backgrounds to his podcast. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, scientists who have different viewpoints, comedians, UFC fighters, gurus, and everyone in between. Rogan follows his curiosity and is not afraid to be controversial.

### Controversies: Indicators of a Type 8?

Rogan's life has not been without controversy. From stirring debates about COVID-19 treatments to sparking uproar with statements about transgender athletes, Rogan's fearless confrontation of divisive issues reflects the challenging nature of Type 8s.
