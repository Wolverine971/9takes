## What is Joe Rogan's Personality Type?

### Joe Rogan is an Enneagram Type 8

Type 8s, known as ["The Challengers,"](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-8) are characterized by their desire to assert dominance and control their environment.

They seek to protect themselves by getting stronger. Their strength can take many forms, physical strength, wealth, power, or even wisdom. They do this because somewhere in their childhood, **they got the message that it was not ok to be weak**. Often, 8s can remember a time when they were vulnerable and taken advantage of.

So, the typical 8s coping mechanism is to armor up and remove any perceived vulnerabilities.

<div class="iframe-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/5i0jPUArFH8?si=MDOPEEVUdnu_NaOW" title="Joe Rogan being motivational" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Enneagram Type 8s are natural leaders characterized by self-confidence, resilience, and a direct approach to life. 8s have been known to unintentionally intimidate others. They also tend to confront life head-on and are always up to a challenge. Fear is not a factor for 8s ðŸ˜‰.

Rogan epitomizes this type. He has had multiple careers, from stand-up comedian to UFC commentator, Fear Factor host, and host of the most popular podcast in the world, the Joe Rogan Experience. Most people only attempt to do some of the things Joe has done. But Joe likes a challenge. Joe is an 8, and he knows that every challenge he faces only makes him stronger.

## Characteristics of Joe Rogan that align with Type 8

### Direct yet open

When outsiders comment on Rogan's podcast, they marvel at how nonchalant and unrefined he is. This is no accident - it's a direct reflection of his Type 8 personality.

Joe doesn't mince words when discussing complex issues with guests, even high-profile ones. Whether he's debating political figures, questioning scientists, or exchanging playful barbs with Dana White during UFC commentary, his outspoken nature shines through. This unfiltered approach is a crucial feature of the Type 8 personality.

Joe can talk this way because he is not hiding anything. His approach to life is characterized by a brash honesty that he uses to get to the root of the matter. It's both disarming and refreshing, creating an environment where his guests feel compelled to reciprocate this openness.

This openness to life, born out of a feeling of being untouchable, creates a sense of comfort and helps people relax and be honest on his podcast. Perhaps the most iconic example of this is the moment when he got Elon Musk to smoke a joint on air:

<div class="iframe-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Nael8xcSus?si=1UkTEJmk1HU5W9bC&amp;start=6" title="Elon Musk and Joe Rogan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

This moment, while controversial, exemplifies how Rogan's Type 8 traits create an atmosphere where guests feel they can be their authentic selves, leading to uniquely candid and revealing conversations.

### Joe Rogan helps his friends

One fascinating aspect of Enneagram Type 8s is that when they are doing well or are in "security," they can embody positive traits of Type 2, known as "the helpers." This shift is evident in Rogan's relationships with his friends and colleagues.

Many of Rogan's friends speak about his generosity and genuine happiness at their success. They describe him as a good friend who gives gifts and celebrates others' achievements. This behavior aligns perfectly with the Type 8's growth direction towards Type 2, where they channel their strength and resources into supporting others.

<div class="iframe-container">
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/en4EJ_ocOqk?si=1UkTEJmk1HU5W9bC&amp;start=225" title="Joe Rogan helping friends" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 </div>

Another name for Enneagram 8s is the "protector." Joe helping his friends can also be seen as protecting what he cares about. Many of Rogan's friends have been in difficult situations, and Rogan has stepped up to help them. This protective instinct is a testament to his character and aligns perfectly with his Enneagram 8 personality.

### Defying Conventions

Type 8s often defy conventions, and Rogan is no exception to this rule.

They are contrarians by nature, which explains why **Rogan loves to hear all sides of a story**. He invites guests from all backgrounds to his podcast. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, scientists who have different viewpoints, comedians, UFC fighters, gurus, and everyone in between find a place on his show.

Rogan follows his curiosity with a fearlessness that is characteristic of Type 8s. He's not afraid to be controversial or to challenge established norms. This willingness to push boundaries and explore taboo topics has both endeared him to millions of listeners and sparked numerous controversies throughout his career.

### Controversies: Indicators of a Type 8?

Rogan's life has not been without controversy. From stirring debates about COVID-19 treatments to sparking uproar with statements about transgender athletes, Rogan's fearless confrontation of divisive issues reflects the challenging nature of Type 8s.

These controversies, while often polarizing, demonstrate Rogan's commitment to open dialogue and his refusal to be constrained by societal expectations. They stem from the Type 8's core fear of being controlled or harmed by others, driving them to challenge authority and question established norms.
