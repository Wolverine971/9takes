> "I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married.' I thought it would threaten my independence — no man should be able to say that I'm his. My view changed with Matt."

<p class="firstLetter">You've heard her voice. You've seen her Instagram. You've probably laughed along with her unfiltered takes on relationships, sex, and life.</p>

Alex Cooper built "Call Her Daddy" from an apartment podcast into a $125 million empire. But 2025 cracked open something deeper: a Hulu documentary revealing decade-old trauma, candid admissions about delaying motherhood, and the kind of vulnerability that reminded everyone the "founding father" is still figuring it out.

What actually drives someone to build this? What's the psychological engine behind the relentless expansion, the willingness to discuss anything on-air, the ability to make celebrities spill secrets they've never shared?

The Enneagram offers a map.

## What Makes Alex Cooper Tick?

Watch any interview with Alex. The rapid-fire speech. The pivot from topic to topic. The refusal to let a conversation get boring.

This is [Enneagram Type 7](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7) energy, pure and unfiltered.

Forbes ranked her the 7th highest-earning creator in 2024 at $32 million. That number didn't happen by accident. It happened because Type 7s are wired for exactly what Alex does: chase opportunities, adapt instantly, and make the whole thing look fun.

### The Type 7 Pattern

Type 7s are experience-seekers. They chase novelty, avoid pain, and somehow make relentless ambition seem effortless.

The pattern shows up as:

- Optimism that borders on stubborn
- Quick thinking and faster pivoting
- Natural magnetism (people want to be around them)
- Opportunity radar always scanning
- Allergic to feeling trapped or limited

Every one of these traits shows up in how Alex runs her business, conducts interviews, and navigates controversy.

## The Making of a Media Mogul

### From Soccer Fields to Studio Microphones

Born August 21, 1994, in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Father: former University of Wisconsin hockey player turned TV sports producer. Mother: psychologist.

That combination matters. The athletic competitiveness. The psychological instinct for making people open up.

Alex earned a Division I soccer scholarship to Boston University, logging 49 appearances for the Terriers from 2013 to 2015. This background explains both her work ethic and her comfort with locker-room talk.

But those college years held something darker. Something she wouldn't discuss publicly for a decade.

<div class="iframe-container">

</div>

After graduating from BU's College of Communication in 2017, Alex moved to New York City. Advertising sales by day. Dreaming of something bigger by night. Her first media taste came anchoring for Dirty Water Media in 2016.

Then 2018 happened.

### From "Gluck Gluck 9000" to "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters"

Alex and Sofia Franklyn launched "Call Her Daddy" from their New York apartment.

The numbers: 12,000 downloads to 2 million in two months. Barstool Sports acquired the show almost immediately.

The early episodes were raw, raunchy, revolutionary. Alex and Sofia flipped the script on sex talk, giving women permission to be as bold and unapologetic as men had always been. The infamous "Gluck Gluck 9000" episode became legend.

This is classic Type 7 territory: pushing boundaries, making it look effortless, turning taboo into entertainment.

Then came the 2020 "Daddy Divorce." Sofia departed amid contract disputes. Alex could have crumbled. Instead, she pivoted, seized full creative control, and evolved the show beyond its original formula.

The messy truth? The public largely heard one side.

Barstool's Dave Portnoy and Alex framed Sofia as "greedy and disloyal" for wanting a better deal. Sofia has since claimed she was "villainized" unfairly. "The betrayal piece was more upsetting than the financial piece," she told the _Trading Secrets_ podcast. She alleged Alex negotiated behind her back, was "willing to stomp" on their friendship for a $60 million payday. Sofia initially chose silence but later reflected that many "pieces were missing" from the public narrative.

Whatever the actual truth, the split became a masterclass in Type 7 reframing. Alex turned professional crisis into an origin story.

Today's "Call Her Daddy" features intimate conversations with <a href="/personality-analysis/Miley-Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href="/personality-analysis/Hailey-Bieber">Hailey Bieber</a>, and Vice President <a href="/personality-analysis/Kamala-Harris">Kamala Harris</a>. Rolling Stone dubbed Alex "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters." From shock jock to skilled interviewer.

### The Art of Getting People to Talk

How does Alex get celebrities to reveal things they've never shared?

It's part Type 7 charm, part her psychologist mother's influence. Three techniques stand out:

**She kills the interview vibe.** "I treat guests as if we are sitting in my living room and we are getting to know each other." She records in sweats. She interviewed Kamala Harris in a hoodie. The informality is deliberate. It lowers defenses.

**She actually listens.** Alex cites Oprah as her model: "Oprah was really the first person that was actually listening." Unlike hosts reading teleprompters, Alex stays present. "I have been on many shows where the host is looking five inches to the right of my head and reading a teleprompter. It's very dehumanizing."

**Flow beats structure.** If a guest goes off-track but is passionate, Alex follows. "Flow is much more important than following a structure." This creates the spontaneous moments that go viral.

The proof? When Miley Cyrus appeared in 2020, she opened up about losing her virginity to Liam Hemsworth, her guilt about privilege, processing heartbreak through lists. These weren't talking points. These were admissions from someone who felt safe enough to be unguarded.

When Vice President Harris sat down in October 2024, the 45-minute conversation produced genuinely revealing moments: Harris pushing back on Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim about humility, discussing her mother's tough-love parenting, exploring what agency means to her. Whether you found it too soft or refreshingly personal, it showed Alex can make even presidential candidates seem human.

This trajectory mirrors Type 7 growth. Surface excitement evolves into deeper substance. The spark stays.

### The Unwell Empire: 2024-2025 Expansion

Alex's ambitions extend far beyond her own podcast. And 2025 has been explosive.

**The SiriusXM Era**

August 2024: $125 million deal with SiriusXM. Three years. Exclusive advertising rights for her entire Unwell Network lineup. February 2025 brought two new channels: Unwell Music (songs that have "scored her life") and Unwell On Air (live programming).

**Network Acquisitions**

January 2025: The Unwell Network acquired true crime podcast "Going West" and lifestyle podcast "Cheers!" First acquisitions of existing shows.

**Creative Agency + Google**

October 2025: The Unwell Creative Agency launched, connecting brands with Gen Z women through sponsored content, live events, and podcasting partnerships. Launch partner? Google. A tech giant betting on Cooper's cultural pull.

**Unwell Hydration**

Alex expanded into beverages with Unwell Hydration, launching exclusively at Target stores nationwide in January 2025. Three flavors. Electrolytes, B-complex vitamins, green coffee extract. Direct competition with <a href="/personality-analysis/Logan-Paul">Logan Paul</a>'s PRIME.

**Television**

She's producing "Overboard for Love," a dating show set on a luxury yacht, for Hulu. First series for Unwell Productions.

This relentless expansion into new territories is pure Type 7. Always seeking the next horizon. Building a life packed with variety and stimulation. Her company now employs nearly 100 people.

## Behind the Scenes: Alex Cooper's Inner World

### Chasing Fulfillment, Avoiding Pain

Type 7s run on a core fear: being trapped, limited, stuck with emotional pain. The core desire? Freedom. Happiness. Exciting experiences.

For Alex, this shows up as relentless pursuit. Her days likely involve podcast preparation, Unwell Network strategy, creative agency management, and planning whatever comes next.

Even her wellness approach reflects the Type 7 flexibility. In interviews, she's shared that her health routine changes daily. Sometimes focused on fitness and hydration. Sometimes much less structured.

Her most famous quirk? She doesn't wash her face. Prefers toners like Paula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Toner instead. This unconventional approach captures something essential: she resists rigid routines.

### The Private Alex: Beyond the Microphone

She broadcasts intimate details to millions. But Alex maintains surprising boundaries around her actual personal life.

Her relationship with film producer Matt Kaplan (ACE Entertainment founder, known for "To All the Boys I've Loved Before") started with a pandemic Zoom call in July 2020. After a long day of meetings with film and TV companies, her last call was with Kaplan's production company. Fans would later know him only as "Mr. Sexy Zoom Man."

Their April 2024 wedding in Riviera Maya, Mexico marked a chapter Alex never expected. "I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married,'" she revealed in her documentary. "I thought it would threaten my independence. No man should be able to say that I'm his."

**What changed?** Not just Kaplan himself. How different he was.

"A lot of men in my past were really intimidated by my success. They tried to suppress what I was doing or make me feel bad about it. Matt has always been my biggest supporter. It's very attractive to have a man not be intimidated by a woman's extreme success."

The foundation is communication: "We had a really great dynamic early on that I didn't have in previous relationships. The amount that we communicate, even over-communicate, about difficult things." When Kaplan proposed, he said: "You're my soulmate, the love of my life. You make me a better man."

A telling detail: Alex walked herself down the aisle. "I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man," she told _Vogue_. "My mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family."

**Family Plans: A Window into Type 7 Psychology**

In a June 2025 podcast episode, Alex got vulnerable about delaying motherhood. She and Matt had planned to start trying for a baby in summer 2024. But after going off birth control (which she'd been on since age 16), she experienced physical struggles and career doubts.

"I just felt in my body that I want to grind at work and I want to be selfish a little longer. I wanna enjoy what I've worked so f\*\*\*ing hard for."

This illustrates the Type 7's internal tension perfectly: the desire for new experiences (motherhood) conflicting with the fear of losing freedom and momentum. The fact that she's examining these feelings publicly, rather than escaping into another project, is itself a sign of growth.

## Navigating Storms: Type 7 Under Pressure

### The Alix Earle Fallout (2025)

When lifestyle influencer [Alix Earle](/personality-analysis/Alix-Earle) signed with The Unwell Network in August 2023, it looked like a perfect pairing. Media's fastest-rising stars, aligned.

By February 2025, Variety broke the news: Earle's "Hot Mess" podcast had been dropped from the network. SiriusXM would no longer sell ads for the show. All rights returned to Earle.

The signs had been brewing. Earle's notable absence from Unwell's high-profile Super Bowl party in New Orleans sparked speculation. Sources cited "a lot of tension" and clashes "over business."

For Alex, this was a rare public failure in relationship management. But Type 7 adaptability means she's likely already focused on the network's other successes rather than dwelling on the loss.

### The "Daddy Divorce" That Could Have Ended Everything

The 2020 split with Sofia Franklyn could have derailed Alex's career entirely. Instead, it showed her Type 7 strengths at full force.

When negotiations with Barstool turned contentious, Alex didn't stay locked in conflict. She negotiated directly with founder <a href="/personality-analysis/Dave-Portnoy">Dave Portnoy</a>, secured creative control, got favorable terms.

Her first solo episode, titled "The Funeral," showcased the Type 7 gift for reframing. She shared her side transparently while charting an exciting path forward. Potential disaster became a career-defining moment.

### "Call Her Alex": Facing the Pain (2025)

The most significant development in Alex's story came in June 2025 with the premiere of "Call Her Alex" at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Directed by Ry Russo-Young, the two-part Hulu documentary traces her journey from a bullied middle-schooler in Pennsylvania to a $125-million empire. But its most shocking revelation involves her time at Boston University.

Alex alleged that her soccer coach, Nancy Feldman (who coached at BU from 1995-2022), subjected her to three years of escalating sexual harassment. According to Cooper: inappropriate comments about her body and sex life, threats and benchings, attempts to be alone with her outside team settings.

Most painfully, Alex alleged that when she and her parents brought documentation to BU's athletic department in 2015, they refused to look at the evidence. Told her they wouldn't fire Feldman.

"I didn't realize how much I had suppressed." She came forward after discovering "the abuse and trauma I had been subjected to at Boston University was still actively happening on that campus in 2025."

This represents profound Type 7 growth. The Enthusiast's typical pattern is to escape pain through new experiences and positive reframing. By sitting with her trauma, documenting it publicly, and advocating for others still suffering, Alex demonstrates movement toward what the Enneagram calls integration: developing the depth and courage to face rather than flee difficult emotions.

## The Cultural Impact: Why People Can't Get Enough

### Creating a Movement, Not Just a Podcast

The "Daddy Gang" isn't just an audience. It's a cultural phenomenon with real demographics behind it.

**Who actually listens?** Nearly 90% women (up from 60% in the early days). 76% under 35. Core demographic: women ages 18-26. The audience leans Democratic (48%) versus Republican (24%). Average listenership: around 10 million per episode.

As Alex describes it: "The Daddy Gang is a bunch of predominantly women that are excited to engage in a roller coaster where we don't know what happens next, but we're on the ride with Alex."

What keeps them loyal? The transparency. From the beginning, Alex built a communication style that leaves nothing hidden. Explicit details about her life. Her failures. Her insecurities. In a world of curated perfection, the Daddy Gang appreciates someone who admits to not washing her face while building an empire.

Her Type 7 enthusiasm is contagious. Listeners feel part of something bigger. This explains how casual listeners become devoted fans who follow her across platforms and ventures.

### The Joe Rogan Comparison: Fair or Limiting?

Alex regularly battles Joe Rogan for the top podcast spot. "Call Her Daddy" ranks second only to "The Joe Rogan Experience" on Spotify's charts. The constant comparison frustrates her.

"Does anybody say, 'Joe Rogan is the male Alex Cooper?' No," she told Jay Shetty's podcast. "We have similar numbers, we have really loyal audiences... it's frustrating that it is a de-qualifier."

The numbers paint an interesting picture. Rogan's audience: 80% male, 32% Republican. Cooper's: 90% female, 48% Democrat. Rogan's $450 million in Spotify deals dwarfs Cooper's $125 million SiriusXM contract. But Cooper commands the female podcast market in a way no one else does.

She admits to a competitive personality but says she doesn't "feel competitive" with Rogan: "Our content is so different." She's right. Comparing them misses the point. Alex dominates a completely different space.

### The Critics: Is "Call Her Daddy" Actually Feminist?

Not everyone is on board. The show has faced sustained criticism from feminist corners. Worth understanding why.

**The "choice feminism" critique.** Critics argue that "Call Her Daddy" delivers "an empty, unthreatening version of feminism" designed to "benefit the systems that uphold the power of heterosexual cisgendered men." The accusation: teaching women how to be sexually bold in ways that serve male desires isn't empowerment. It's "internalized misogyny" with better marketing.

**The Barstool problem.** Until 2021, the show was owned by Barstool Sports. Founder Dave Portnoy has faced sexual abuse allegations and made problematic statements about consent. Critics argue that signing with Barstool undermined any feminist credibility from day one.

**The diversity gap.** Others point out that "most of Cooper's guests are incredibly wealthy, primarily white, cis-gender and straight." When the show discusses "women's issues," whose women does it mean?

**The Kamala backlash.** The 2024 Harris interview drew accusations of "peddling propaganda" from listeners who felt Cooper soft-balled a political candidate. Some fans felt betrayed by what they saw as the show choosing sides.

**Cooper's response?** She's been clear: "Her podcast was never supposed to be feminist." While she wants to empower women, "her brand is not specifically feminist." It's a distinction that frustrates critics but may actually be more honest than claiming ideological purity.

### Redefining Female Empowerment (On Her Terms)

Alex's most significant cultural impact? Normalizing women's candid conversations about sex, relationships, and ambition. Even if "empowerment" means different things to different people.

Early episodes focused on sexual tips that some found liberating and others found regressive. Today's "Call Her Daddy" tackles mental health, business strategies, and trauma recovery. This evolution mirrors Alex's own growth. Her audience has grown with her.

By sharing her business successes transparently, Alex has inspired women to pursue entrepreneurial dreams. Her $125 million SiriusXM deal sent a message about women's value in digital media.

Her documentary revelations about harassment add another dimension. She's now modeling how to speak truth to power, even when it's painful.

## What's Next for Alex Cooper?

If her Type 7 pattern continues, expect:

**More media, less audio-only.** "Overboard for Love" is in production. Her documentary succeeded. More television and streaming content seems inevitable.

**Product diversification.** Unwell Hydration is likely just the start. Lifestyle products aligned with her brand could follow.

**Agency growth.** With Google as a partner, expect major brand campaigns and activations targeting Gen Z women.

**Personal evolution.** Like many Type 7s entering their 30s, Alex may continue integrating Type 5 qualities: developing deeper expertise and introspection while maintaining her signature enthusiasm. Her willingness to discuss motherhood delays and past trauma suggests this integration is already underway.

## The Method Behind the Madness

From wild beginnings to media mogul status, Alex Cooper's journey makes perfect sense through the Enneagram Type 7 lens.

The endless pursuit of new experiences. The remarkable adaptability. The ability to transform challenges into opportunities. All classic Enthusiast patterns.

But 2025 revealed something more. A woman learning to sit with pain. To speak difficult truths. To grow beyond the stereotype of Type 7 avoidance.

Alex isn't just living the Type 7 dream. She's showing how that dream can mature into something deeper. You can be endlessly ambitious and authentically vulnerable. Empire-building and truth-telling.
