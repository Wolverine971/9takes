> "I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married.' I thought it would threaten my independence — no man should be able to say that I'm his. My view changed with Matt."

## What Makes Alex Cooper Tick? Uncovering Her Personality Type

With her boundless energy, rapid-fire speech, and insatiable curiosity, Alex Cooper radiates Enneagram Type 7 energy – ["The Enthusiast."](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7)

Now the 7th highest-earning creator according to Forbes (with $32 million in 2024 earnings), Alex didn't get there by accident. Her Type 7 traits have been the rocket fuel propelling her meteoric rise.

### Hallmarks of an Enneagram Type 7 Personality

Type 7s are the ultimate experience-seekers. These vibrant souls chase novelty and stimulation, diving headfirst into new adventures while skillfully avoiding pain or discomfort.

They're typically:

- Optimistic and resilient
- Quick-thinking and adaptable
- Charming and socially magnetic
- Entrepreneurial and opportunity-focused
- Resistant to limitations or confinement

Sound familiar? Alex Cooper embodies these traits in everything from her business decisions to her interview style.

## The Making of a Media Mogul: Alex Cooper's Journey

### From Soccer Fields to Studio Microphones

Born August 21, 1994, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, Alex's competitive drive emerged early.

Her father, a former hockey player for the University of Wisconsin turned TV sports producer, instilled that athletic spirit. Her mother, a psychologist, perhaps unwittingly contributed to Alex's natural ability to get people talking about their innermost thoughts and feelings.

Alex earned a Division I soccer scholarship to Boston University, making 49 appearances and scoring one goal for the Terriers from 2013 to 2015. This athletic background explains both her disciplined work ethic and her comfort with locker-room talk.

But as her 2025 documentary "Call Her Alex" revealed, those college years held darkness alongside achievement—a story she suppressed for a decade.

</div>

After graduating from BU's College of Communication in 2017, Alex moved to New York City, working in advertising sales while dreaming of something bigger. Her first taste of media came as an anchor for Dirty Water Media in 2016, where she began developing her on-camera charisma.

But it wasn't until 2018 that Alex would find her true calling.

### From "Gluck Gluck 9000" to "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters"

In 2018, Alex and Sofia Franklyn launched "Call Her Daddy," initially recording in their New York apartment.

The podcast exploded almost overnight – growing from 12,000 to 2 million downloads in just two months. Barstool Sports quickly acquired the show, sensing its massive potential.

The early "Call Her Daddy" episodes were raw, raunchy, and revolutionary. Alex and Sofia flipped the script on sex talk, giving women permission to be just as bold and unapologetic as men had always been. The infamous "Gluck Gluck 9000" episode became the stuff of legend.

This willingness to venture where others wouldn't dare is quintessential Type 7 behavior – pushing boundaries while making it seem effortless and fun.

When the infamous "Daddy Divorce" happened in 2020 (with Sofia departing amid contract disputes), Alex showcased another Type 7 superpower: adaptability. Rather than crumbling, she pivoted, taking full creative control and evolving the show beyond its initial formula.

Today's "Call Her Daddy" features intimate conversations with celebrities like <a href="/personality-analysis/Miley-Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href="/personality-analysis/Hailey-Bieber">Hailey Bieber</a>, and even Vice President <a href="/personality-analysis/Kamala-Harris">Kamala Harris</a>. Rolling Stone dubbed Alex "Gen-Z's Barbara Walters" – a testament to her growth from shock jock to skilled interviewer.

This evolution parallels the Type 7's growth journey – from seeking surface-level excitement to developing deeper substance without losing that essential spark.

### Building The Unwell Empire: 2024-2025 Expansion

Alex's ambitions extend far beyond her own podcast—and 2025 has seen explosive growth.

**The SiriusXM Era Begins**

In August 2024, she secured a staggering $125 million deal with SiriusXM, replacing Spotify as her distribution and advertising partner. The deal covers just over three years and gives SiriusXM exclusive advertising rights for her entire Unwell Network lineup.

February 2025 saw the launch of two new SiriusXM channels: Unwell Music (a curated mixtape of songs that have "scored her life") and Unwell On Air (live programming).

**Network Acquisitions and Growth**

The Unwell Network continued expanding in January 2025 with the acquisition of true crime podcast "Going West" and lifestyle podcast "Cheers!" – the network's first acquisition of existing shows.

**The Unwell Creative Agency and Google Partnership**

In October 2025, Alex announced The Unwell Creative Agency, a new division connecting brands with Gen Z women through sponsored content, live events, and podcasting partnerships. The agency debuted with a multiyear creative partnership with Google—a tech giant betting on Cooper's cultural influence.

**Unwell Hydration**

Not content with audio domination, Alex expanded into beverages with Unwell Hydration, launching exclusively at Target stores nationwide in January 2025. With three flavors containing electrolytes, B-complex vitamins, and green coffee extract, she's competing directly with brands like <a href="/personality-analysis/Logan-Paul">Logan Paul</a>'s PRIME.

**Television Production**

Alex is also producing "Overboard for Love," a dating show set on a luxury yacht, for Hulu—her first series for Unwell Productions.

This constant expansion into new territories is classic Type 7 behavior – always seeking the next horizon, building a life full of variety and stimulation. Her company now employs nearly 100 staff across its various divisions.

## Behind the Scenes: The Inner World of Alex Cooper

### Chasing Fulfillment, Avoiding Pain

Type 7s are driven by a core fear of being trapped, limited, or experiencing emotional pain. Their core desire is for freedom, happiness, and exciting experiences.

For Alex, this manifests in her relentless pursuit of new projects and opportunities. Her workdays likely involve podcast preparation, business strategy for The Unwell Network, managing the new creative agency, and planning future ventures.

Even her approach to wellness reflects this Type 7 flexibility. In interviews, Alex has shared that her health routine changes daily – sometimes focused on fitness and hydration, other times much less structured.

Her most famous wellness quirk? She doesn't wash her face – preferring toners like Paula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Toner instead. This unconventional approach perfectly captures her resistance to rigid routines.

### The Private Alex: Beyond the Microphone

While she broadcasts intimate details to millions, Alex maintains surprising boundaries around her personal life.

Her relationship with film producer Matt Kaplan (founder of ACE Entertainment, known for "To All the Boys I've Loved Before") began with a Zoom call during the pandemic in July 2020. Fans first knew him as "Mr. Sexy Zoom Man."

Their April 2024 wedding in Riviera Maya, Mexico marked a new chapter – one that Cooper admits she never expected. "I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married,'" she revealed in her documentary. "I thought it would threaten my independence."

**Family Plans: A Window into Type 7 Psychology**

In a remarkably vulnerable June 2025 podcast episode, Alex opened up about delaying motherhood. She revealed they'd planned to start trying for a baby in summer 2024, but after going off birth control (which she'd been on since age 16), she experienced physical struggles and career doubts.

"I just felt in my body that I want to grind at work and I want to be selfish a little longer. I wanna enjoy what I've worked so f\*\*\*ing hard for," she told listeners.

This candid admission perfectly illustrates the Type 7's internal tension: the desire for new experiences (motherhood) conflicting with the fear of losing freedom and momentum. It's growth that she's even examining these feelings publicly rather than simply escaping into another project.

## Navigating Storms: How Type 7 Traits Carried Alex Through Controversies

### The Alix Earle Fallout (2025)

When lifestyle influencer Alix Earle signed with The Unwell Network in August 2023, it seemed like a perfect pairing of media's fastest-rising stars.

But by February 2025, Variety broke the news that Earle's "Hot Mess" podcast had been dropped from the network. SiriusXM would no longer sell ads for the show, and all rights were returned to Earle.

The signs had been brewing: Earle's notable absence from Unwell's high-profile Super Bowl party in New Orleans sparked speculation. Sources cited "a lot of tension" and clashes "over business."

For Alex, this represented a rare public failure in relationship management. Yet her Type 7 adaptability means she's likely already focused on the network's other successes rather than dwelling on the loss.

### The "Daddy Divorce" That Could Have Ended Everything

The 2020 split with Sofia Franklyn could have derailed Alex's career entirely. Instead, it showcased her Type 7 strengths.

When negotiations with Barstool Sports turned contentious, Alex demonstrated remarkable adaptability. Rather than remaining locked in conflict, she negotiated directly with Barstool founder <a href="/personality-analysis/Dave-Portnoy">Dave Portnoy</a>, securing creative control and favorable terms.

In her first solo episode, titled "The Funeral," Alex exhibited the Type 7's gift for reframing challenges as opportunities. She transparently shared her side of the story while charting an exciting path forward – turning potential disaster into a career-defining moment.

### "Call Her Alex": Facing the Pain (2025)

Perhaps the most significant development in Alex's story came in June 2025 with the premiere of "Call Her Alex" at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Directed by Ry Russo-Young, the two-part Hulu documentary traces her journey from a bullied middle-schooler in Pennsylvania to the helm of a $125-million empire. But its most shocking revelation involves her time at Boston University.

Alex alleged that her soccer coach, Nancy Feldman (who coached at BU from 1995-2022), subjected her to three years of escalating sexual harassment. According to Cooper, Feldman made inappropriate comments about her body and sex life, threatened retaliation and benched her, and attempted to be alone with her outside team settings.

Most painfully, Alex alleged that when she and her parents brought documentation to BU's athletic department in 2015, they refused to look at the evidence and told her they wouldn't fire Feldman.

"I didn't realize how much I had suppressed," Alex said. She explained she came forward after discovering "the abuse and trauma I had been subjected to at Boston University was still actively happening on that campus in 2025."

This represents profound Type 7 growth. The Enthusiast's typical pattern is to escape pain through new experiences and positive reframing. By sitting with her trauma, documenting it publicly, and advocating for others still suffering, Alex demonstrates integration toward her "security point" – developing the depth and courage to face rather than flee difficult emotions.

## The Cultural Impact: Why People Can't Get Enough of Alex Cooper

### Creating a Movement, Not Just a Podcast

The "Daddy Gang" isn't just an audience – it's a cultural phenomenon.

Alex has masterfully created a community around her show, with millions of followers making "Call Her Daddy" consistently one of the top podcasts globally. In 2024, she ranked as the 7th highest-earning creator on Forbes' list.

Her Type 7 enthusiasm is contagious, drawing listeners into her world and making them feel part of something bigger. This magnetic quality explains how she's transformed casual listeners into devoted fans who follow her across platforms and ventures.

### Redefining Female Empowerment

Perhaps Alex's most significant cultural impact has been normalizing women's candid conversations about sex, relationships, and ambition.

While early episodes focused on sexual empowerment (sometimes controversially), today's "Call Her Daddy" tackles everything from mental health stigmas to business strategies to trauma recovery. This evolution mirrors Alex's own growth – and has brought her audience along for the journey.

By sharing her business successes transparently, Alex has inspired countless women to pursue their own entrepreneurial dreams. Her $125 million SiriusXM deal sent a powerful message about women's value in digital media.

Her documentary revelations about harassment add another dimension: she's now modeling how to speak truth to power, even when it's painful.

## The Future According to Alex Cooper: What's Next for This Type 7 Icon?

What does the future hold for Alex Cooper? If her Type 7 pattern continues, expect:

**Media Expansion Beyond Audio**: With "Overboard for Love" in production and her documentary success, more television and streaming content seems inevitable.

**Product Diversification**: Unwell Hydration is likely just the beginning. Lifestyle products aligning with her brand values could follow.

**The Unwell Creative Agency Growth**: With Google as a partner, expect major brand campaigns and activations targeting Gen Z women.

**Personal Evolution**: Like many Type 7s entering their 30s, Alex may continue integrating Type 5 qualities – developing deeper expertise and introspection while maintaining her signature enthusiasm. Her willingness to discuss motherhood delays and past trauma suggests this integration is already underway.

## Wrapping Up: The Method Behind the Madness

From wild beginnings to media mogul status, Alex Cooper's journey makes perfect sense through the Enneagram Type 7 lens.

Her endless pursuit of new experiences, remarkable adaptability, and ability to transform challenges into opportunities all reflect classic Enthusiast patterns. Yet 2025 has revealed something more: a woman learning to sit with pain, speak difficult truths, and grow beyond the stereotype of Type 7 avoidance.

Alex isn't just living the Type 7 dream – she's showing how that dream can mature into something deeper. She's proving that you can be both endlessly ambitious and authentically vulnerable, both empire-building and truth-telling.
