> "Sacrifice the need to be liked for a more fulfilling life... Don't be afraid to be freaky."

<p class="firstLetter">In a world of carefully curated influencer personas, Brittany Broski stood in a break room, tried kombucha for the first time, and became one of the most authentic voices on the internet.</p>

That 8-second video captured something rare: genuine human reaction in all its contradictory glory. But what transformed "Kombucha Girl" from a viral meme into a genuine entertainment career wasn't luck. It was the psychology of someone who can't help but chase every fascinating rabbit hole while making you laugh along the way.

Understanding Brittany through the lens of personality psychology reveals why she's built such a fiercely loyal following — and why she's probably already onto her next hyperfixation before you finish reading this sentence.

## What is Brittany Broski's Personality Type?

### Brittany Broski is an Enneagram Type 7

Watch any episode of The Broski Report and you'll see [Type 7 energy](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7) in its purest form. One moment Brittany is explaining the etymology of an obscure word, the next she's reenacting a 1920s debutante, then suddenly pivoting to discuss her mobile game addiction and the "alarming" amount of money she's spent on Cake Sort.

This isn't chaos. This is how a Type 7 mind works.

Type 7s — The Enthusiasts — are driven by a core need for satisfaction and freedom. They fear being trapped in emotional pain or limitation, so they keep moving, keep learning, keep finding the next source of stimulation. Their superpower is turning mundane life into an adventure. Their challenge is sitting still long enough to process the hard stuff.

**"I struggle with a lack of motivation and energy,"** Brittany has admitted on her podcast. **"I often need the fear of disappointing others as motivation to engage in day-to-day activities."**

This vulnerability reveals something crucial about Type 7 psychology. Beneath the constant enthusiasm lies a sophisticated avoidance system. By staying busy, staying entertained, and staying connected to her audience, Brittany keeps the darker emotions at bay — most of the time.

## Brittany's Military Brat Childhood

The daughter of a 20-year Air Force veteran, Brittany didn't just grow up — she grew up everywhere. Georgia. Texas. Arizona. Alabama. North Carolina. Virginia. South Korea. Each move meant new schools, new friendships to build, new social landscapes to navigate.

This kind of childhood shapes a Type 7 in specific ways.

Most kids develop their personality within stable environments. Military brats learn to adapt fast. They become skilled at reading new social situations, finding common ground quickly, and developing portable personalities that work anywhere. For a naturally enthusiastic Type 7, this constant change becomes training ground for the very skills that would later make Brittany a natural entertainer.

Her mother Heather, a self-described ghost hunter who runs "Texas Ghost Gals," clearly passed along a comfort with the unconventional. Meanwhile, her father's bluegrass and 1950s pop music became part of Brittany's emotional DNA — explaining why her debut single "The Sun" leans into those vintage influences.

**"Mom loved The Monkees, and dad dug bluegrass and classic fifties pop,"** Brittany has shared. This musical heritage shows up in her artistic choices decades later, proving that Type 7s don't actually forget their past — they just integrate it into ever-expanding interests.

Her theater participation as a kid — performing in local productions of The Addams Family, Bus Stop, and Spamalot — gave her structured outlets for the performative energy that Type 7s naturally possess. The improv troupe in high school was even more formative. Improv demands exactly what Type 7s do naturally: quick thinking, enthusiastic yes-and energy, and the ability to transform any scenario into entertainment.

## The Kombucha Moment: When Viral Fame Found a Type 7

In August 2019, Brittany Tomlinson was working at a bank in trust and investment services. She had graduated magna cum laude from Texas A&M with a communications degree. She was following the expected path.

Then her friends convinced her to download TikTok.

The kombucha video — 8 seconds of genuine reaction as she tasted the fermented drink for the first time — captured something that feels increasingly rare online: authentic human emotion without performance. Her face cycled through disgust, confusion, reconsideration, and something approaching reluctant appreciation. It was relatable in a way that felt almost accidental.

The video gained 1.8 million likes in three days. It went viral on "gay Twitter" first, then Reddit, then everywhere. TikTok ranked it among the top ten most viral videos of 2019.

And then her employer fired her.

**"We think it's best that you're no longer affiliated with our bank,"** they told her. **"This is not becoming of a young professional."** She had to pack her desk the same day.

Here's where Type 7 psychology becomes visible. For most people, getting fired would be devastating. For Brittany, it became fuel.

**"If there was ever a time to show that I'm funny and I'm more than some Jim Carrey faces, it's now,"** she decided. Within weeks, she was creating consistent content — impressions, skits, accents, the rapid-fire style that would define her career.

This is the Type 7 response to pain: transform it into possibility. The job loss wasn't a setback; it was permission to pursue what she actually wanted. The fear of limitation (being trapped in a bank job) was replaced by the thrill of unlimited creative potential.

## Building an Empire on Enthusiasm

What makes Brittany's career trajectory fascinating from a Type 7 perspective is how she keeps expanding rather than deepening. Most creators find their niche and optimize it. Brittany treats every platform as a new playground.

The timeline tells the story:

**2019-2020:** TikTok content creator, signed to talent management, appeared in Sabra hummus Super Bowl ad, moved to LA with Sarah Schauer

**2021:** Hosted TikTok's official podcast "For You"

**2022-2023:** Co-hosted "Violating Community Guidelines" podcast with Sarah Schauer

**2023-present:** Launched "The Broski Report" solo podcast (reached #4 on Spotify's USA Top Podcasts)

**2023-present:** Created "Royal Court" YouTube interview show featuring celebrities in medieval-themed setting

**2025:** Released debut single "The Sun" and cover of [Harry Styles](/personality-analysis/Harry-Styles)' "Adore You," announced concept album

Each expansion follows classic Type 7 logic. Once a format feels mastered or limiting, it's time to try something new. The podcast with Sarah ended after two years — the circumstances remain private, but the pattern of moving toward new challenges is consistent.

"Royal Court" represents Brittany at her most strategically Type 7. She looked at the crowded landscape of celebrity interview shows and thought: what if instead of imitating Hot Ones, I dressed in elaborate royal costumes and created an entirely different vibe?

**"I didn't want to make just another celebrity podcast,"** she explained. The result features guests like Charli XCX, [Saoirse Ronan](/personality-analysis/Saoirse-Ronan), [Hozier](/personality-analysis/Hozier), and David Corenswet (whom she called a "career highlight" to interview).

## Brittany's Mind: Etymology, Knitting, and Controlled Chaos

### The Hyperfixation Pattern

**"My current hyperfixations include etymology, knitting, and watching TikTok lives,"** Brittany once listed. This casual admission reveals Type 7 psychology in action.

Most people have hobbies. Type 7s have obsessions that rotate. They dive deep into something, extract maximum stimulation, then shift to the next thing before boredom sets in. The word "hyperfixation" — borrowed from ADHD vocabulary — describes exactly how Type 7s engage with interests.

The etymology obsession is particularly telling. Understanding where words come from satisfies the Type 7 need for depth without requiring emotional processing. It's intellectually stimulating, endlessly expandable (there are always more words), and provides interesting content for her podcast.

### Authenticity as Strategy

Brittany has built her brand on being genuinely weird. Not calculated weird — actually weird.

**"One of Broski's core values is authenticity and making sure that she is always herself on and off camera,"** observers have noted. Her friends Drew Afualo and Caleb Hearon share this commitment to genuine presence.

For Type 7s, authenticity serves a dual purpose. It creates connection (which feels stimulating and positive) while also reducing the cognitive load of maintaining a fake persona. The "Broski Nation" fanbase responds to this realness because it gives them permission to be equally unfiltered.

**"Relatability is rewarded,"** Brittany has observed, **"but at what cost? Because now I'm sharing so many personal details about myself with six million people, who can in turn, weaponize that and use it against me."**

This quote reveals the Type 7's growing awareness of vulnerability costs. The very openness that creates connection also creates exposure.

### The Social Media Critique

Brittany doesn't just use social media — she analyzes it like a cultural critic. She's compared the dopamine hits from likes and interactions to addiction. She's criticized how platforms exploit human psychology to keep users engaged.

**"I find myself critiquing the compulsive tendencies where individuals reshape themselves into brands to cater to their following and algorithmic preferences, risking their authentic identity,"** she's shared.

This meta-awareness is unusual for Type 7s, who typically avoid uncomfortable analysis. It suggests Brittany is accessing her growth direction toward [Type 5](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-5) — integrating more depth and reflection into her natural enthusiasm.

## The Health Journey: When Type 7 Meets Type 1

In 2024, Brittany publicly documented her PCOS diagnosis and subsequent health transformation. She lost 27 pounds through medical treatment (Metformin and Semaglutide), dietary changes, and consistent exercise.

**"Body by my PCOS doctor who actually cares if I live or die,"** she posted, characteristically turning a medical journey into relatable content.

But the health journey reveals something deeper about Type 7 stress patterns. When Type 7s are overwhelmed, they move toward [Type 1](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-1) — the Perfectionist. Suddenly the enthusiastic person who resists routine becomes rigid, self-critical, and focused on "doing things right."

Brittany's discussions of seasonal depression, therapy experiences, and diet modifications show this stress pattern playing out. The Type 7 who naturally avoids pain was forced to confront physical symptoms that couldn't be escaped through distraction.

**"I suspect that my diet and hormonal issues may be factors contributing to my mood swings and seasonal depression,"** she's analyzed. This kind of systematic self-examination is Type 1 territory — and it's not comfortable for a Type 7.

The positive outcome: she developed what she calls "safety systems" — ways to honor her body's needs without losing her spontaneous spirit. The weight loss became not just physical transformation but proof that she could integrate discipline without losing herself.

## The Cody Ko Controversy: Navigating Public Accountability

In July 2024, Brittany faced her most significant public criticism when she responded to allegations against Cody Ko (whom Tana Mongeau accused of inappropriate behavior when she was 17).

Brittany wrote: **"I'm crushed to learn about the Cody allegations. If it's proven to be true then that's extremely upsetting as a collaborator and longtime fan."**

The phrase "if it's proven to be true" drew immediate backlash. Critics felt it was dismissive given the allegations had been public for weeks.

From a Type 7 perspective, this response reveals the conflict between maintaining positivity and addressing uncomfortable realities. Type 7s instinctively reframe situations toward the lighter interpretation. The conditional language wasn't necessarily defending Cody Ko — it was Brittany's unconscious attempt to preserve some positive possibility in a painful situation.

She also had prior tension with Tana Mongeau, having declined to appear on Mongeau's "Cancelled" podcast with the text: **"OMFG, you know I love you, but my fans would literally stab and kill me on a campfire if I did."**

The controversy shows the limits of Type 7 conflict avoidance. Sometimes you can't joke your way out of hard situations. Sometimes the enthusiastic personality has to sit with discomfort and give straightforward responses — even when the situation is ambiguous.

## Current Work and Future Trajectory

In March 2025, Brittany released her debut single "The Sun," co-written with Luke Niccoli (who's worked with Carly Rae Jepsen and the Kid LAROI). She described it as **"ethereal, whimsical, but also at the core of it, a stink face bluesy rock song."**

Her musical influences — Hozier, Florence & the Machine, Mumford and Sons — represent her most personal creative expression yet. Music was always the underlying dream, even as comedy content paid the bills.

**"I grew up in the church and always gravitated towards bluesy rock-and-roll music from the '50s and '60s,"** she's explained. The concept album she's developing represents a Type 7 reaching for deeper creative expression rather than just broader expansion.

Royal Court continues building toward her vision of becoming an **"absolutely necessary press stop for anyone promoting anything"** — like a millennial-coded late-night talk show. The show has close to half a million YouTube subscribers and regularly lands A-list guests.

The Broski Report remains her most direct connection to "Broski Nation," offering weekly doses of her unfiltered perspective on everything from philosophy to personal grooming habits.

## Understanding Brittany's Type 7 Mind

What makes Brittany Broski compelling isn't just her enthusiasm — it's her willingness to show the anxiety underneath it.

The Type 7 fear of being trapped in pain is real. The coping mechanism of constant stimulation and humor is real. But so is her growing capacity to sit with difficult emotions rather than immediately reframing them.

**"The depth of perceptions contributes to existential struggles and mental health challenges,"** she's reflected on her podcast. She advocates for viewing mental health issues with empathy rather than romanticizing the "tortured artist" trope.

This represents integrated Type 7 wisdom: acknowledging that the brightness and the darkness both exist, that the enthusiasm doesn't erase the anxiety, and that authentic connection requires showing both.

Brittany Broski turned an 8-second kombucha reaction into a multi-platform career by being genuinely herself — scattered interests, anxious energy, bluegrass heart, and all. Her Type 7 psychology drives the constant expansion, the enthusiasm overflow, and the instinct to transform pain into content. But her growth shows someone learning that depth and stillness aren't the enemies of joy.
