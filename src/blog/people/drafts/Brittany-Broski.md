> "Sacrifice the need to be liked for a more fulfilling life... Don't be afraid to be freaky."

<p class="firstLetter">Brittany Broski stood in a break room, tried kombucha, and became one of the most authentic voices on the internet. No filter. No strategy. Just a face that couldn't lie about how weird fermented tea tastes.</p>

That 8-second video captured something rare: genuine human reaction in all its contradictory glory. But what transformed "Kombucha Girl" from viral meme into TIME100 Creator, chart-topping podcaster, and rising musician wasn't luck. It was the psychology of someone who can't help but chase every fascinating rabbit hole while making you laugh along the way.

Understanding Brittany through the lens of personality psychology reveals why she's built such a fiercely loyal following. And why she's probably already onto her next hyperfixation before you finish reading this sentence.

Her stage name "Broski"? Pure 2012 internet slang. A playful twist on "bro" that stuck so hard her real last name, Tomlinson, has essentially disappeared. She wouldn't change it for the world.

## What is Brittany Broski's Personality Type?

### Brittany Broski is an Enneagram Type 7

Watch any episode of The Broski Report and you'll see [Type 7 energy](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7) in its purest form. One moment Brittany is explaining the etymology of an obscure word. The next she's reenacting a 1920s debutante. Then suddenly she's discussing her mobile game addiction and the "alarming" amount of money she's spent on Cake Sort.

This isn't chaos. This is how a Type 7 mind works.

Type 7s (The Enthusiasts) are driven by a core need for satisfaction and freedom. They fear being trapped in emotional pain or limitation, so they keep moving, keep learning, keep finding the next source of stimulation. Their superpower is turning mundane life into an adventure. Their challenge is sitting still long enough to process the hard stuff.

**"I struggle with a lack of motivation and energy,"** Brittany has admitted on her podcast. **"I often need the fear of disappointing others as motivation to engage in day-to-day activities."**

This vulnerability reveals something crucial about Type 7 psychology. Beneath the constant enthusiasm lies a sophisticated avoidance system. By staying busy, staying entertained, staying connected to her audience, Brittany keeps the darker emotions at bay. Most of the time.

In a 2025 Hollywood Reporter interview, she revealed another layer: **"I'm such a people pleaser, I'm a Taurus. It's hard to change everything about yourself immediately so that people will like you and that's just a never-ending spiral."**

This cuts against the Type 7 stereotype of carefree confidence. The enthusiasm isn't just joy. It's also a bridge to connection, a way to be liked, a defense against the fear that she might not be enough.

## What Makes Brittany Actually Funny

"Funny internet person" doesn't capture what Brittany does. Her comedy operates on multiple registers simultaneously.

**The Impressions:** Brittany drops into accents and characters on a dime. Peaky Blinders-style gangster. 1920s debutante. Southern church lady. Irish lilt. British aristocrat. Jojo Siwa. Hugh Jackman. Minion voice from Despicable Me. The impressions aren't technically perfect. They're funnier than that. They capture the _energy_ of a person or archetype.

**The Tangents:** Watch any episode of The Broski Report and you'll see her start with a topic (say, obnoxious gym bros who work in tech) and end up thirty minutes later explaining the etymology of "solstice" or the problematic history of McDonald's Uncle O'Grimacey character. The chaos isn't random. It follows the associative logic of a genuinely curious mind.

**The Physical Comedy:** That original kombucha video worked because her face told a complete story in 8 seconds. Disgust cycling into confusion into reluctant appreciation. She inherited something from Jim Carrey in her willingness to let her face do absurd things.

**The Bits:** Her "official" obsessions become recurring content. The running bit about being "in love" with Hozier and expecting to move to Ireland "any day now." The elaborate medieval costume commitment for Royal Court. The way she'll fully commit to a premise and refuse to break.

The improv background shows. Two different high school improv troupes plus college improv taught her the "yes, and" energy that lets her follow ridiculous premises to their logical conclusions.

## Brittany's Military Brat Childhood

### Growing Up Everywhere

The daughter of a 20-year Air Force veteran, Brittany didn't just grow up. She grew up everywhere. Georgia. Texas. Arizona. Alabama. North Carolina. Virginia. And South Korea. Each move meant new schools, new friendships to build, new social landscapes to navigate.

This kind of childhood shapes a Type 7 in specific ways.

Most kids develop their personality within stable environments. Military brats learn to adapt fast. They become skilled at reading new social situations, finding common ground quickly, developing portable personalities that work anywhere. For a naturally enthusiastic Type 7, this constant change becomes training ground for the very skills that would later make Brittany a natural entertainer.

Despite frequent relocations, Texas remained home base. Her mother Heather's Texas roots and her father Jeff's Tennessee family ties kept the connection strong.

### The Tomlinson Family

Her mother Heather runs "Texas Ghost Gals," a professional ghost hunting operation. That comfort with the unconventional clearly got passed down. Meanwhile, her father's musical taste became part of Brittany's emotional DNA.

**"Mom loved The Monkees, and dad dug bluegrass and classic fifties pop,"** Brittany has shared.

This musical heritage shows up in her artistic choices decades later. It explains why her debut single "The Sun" leans into vintage rock influences and why she cites Hozier, Florence + the Machine, and Mumford and Sons as inspirations.

She grew up alongside two younger siblings, Sierra and Jet Tomlinson, with whom she maintains a close bond and occasionally collaborates on content.

### The Theater Kid Who Found Her Stage

Brittany's theater participation as a kid (The Addams Family, Bus Stop, Spamalot) gave her structured outlets for the performative energy that Type 7s naturally possess. The improv troupes at _both_ her high schools were even more formative.

Improv demands exactly what Type 7s do naturally: quick thinking, enthusiastic yes-and energy, the ability to transform any scenario into entertainment. Her friends told her she should audition for SNL. Her response, with characteristic humor: "That's not how that works. You don't just audition for SNL."

She was also an athlete in high school, participating in multiple sports. Another outlet for that restless Type 7 energy that needs constant stimulation.

### Breaking from the Church

Brittany was raised in a conservative Texas household, alternating between Baptist and Pentecostal traditions. Her departure from organized religion reveals the Type 7's resistance to limitation and external control.

**"I was raised with all that southern religious trauma,"** she's shared on The Broski Report.

Her growing discontent with the church's views on gender, human rights, and social justice led to her decision to distance herself. She began questioning the emotionally charged worship music and what she perceived as hypocrisy among American Christians.

The departure caused strain with her deeply religious family. It incited feelings of self-loathing and resentment. But eventually, as she's documented, she found **"tranquility and self-forgiveness."**

This journey reflects classic Type 7 psychology: when systems feel constraining or inauthentic, they break free. Even at significant personal cost. She's reaffirmed her emotional attachment to worship music, acknowledging that the memories still stir complicated feelings.

## The Kombucha Moment: When Viral Fame Found a Type 7

In August 2019, Brittany Tomlinson was working at a bank in trust and investment services. She had graduated magna cum laude from Texas A&M with a communications degree and a minor in Spanish. She was following the expected path.

Then her friends convinced her to download TikTok.

The kombucha video (8 seconds of genuine reaction as she tasted the fermented drink for the first time) captured something that feels increasingly rare online: authentic human emotion without performance. Her face cycled through disgust, confusion, reconsideration, and something approaching reluctant appreciation. Relatable in a way that felt almost accidental.

The video gained 1.8 million likes in three days. It went viral on "gay Twitter" first, then Reddit, then everywhere. TikTok ranked it among the top ten most viral videos of 2019. It's now been viewed over 27 million times.

And then her employer fired her.

**"We think it's best that you're no longer affiliated with our bank,"** they told her. **"This is not becoming of a young professional."** She had to pack her desk the same day.

Here's where Type 7 psychology becomes visible. For most people, getting fired would be devastating. For Brittany, it became fuel.

**"If there was ever a time to show that I'm funny and I'm more than some Jim Carrey faces, it's now,"** she decided. Within weeks, she was creating consistent content. Impressions, skits, accents, the rapid-fire style that would define her career.

This is the Type 7 response to pain: transform it into possibility.

The job loss wasn't a setback. It was permission.

She's never publicly named the bank, and likely never will. That's the rare detail she's kept private.

## Texas Girl in a West Coast World

In December 2019, right before the pandemic shut everything down, Brittany made what she called a "jump off the cliff and hope you know how to fly" move to LA. Her Texas lease was up. The viral moment was fading. It was now or never.

The culture shock was real.

**"People on the west coast are nice, but it is like a fake nice,"** Brittany has observed. **"In the south, southern hospitality runs true and deep. When people talk to you in line at the grocery store, it's because they genuinely care about how your day is going. Whenever I go home, I forgot how nice people can be."**

Beyond the social adjustment, there was the pressure. She's said she's **"never felt more pressure to be beautiful"** than living in LA. A jarring shift from Texas norms.

Initially she thought of LA as "a necessary evil" for her career. But over time: **"I kind of love living here."**

Still, her **"Southern roots run very deep."** The music, food, humor, and sense of community that shaped her childhood remain central to her identity. She's discussed on The Broski Report the complicated emotions of returning to Texas, the concept of "home" when you've built a life somewhere else.

## Building an Empire on Enthusiasm

From a Type 7 lens, Brittany's career trajectory reveals something fascinating: she keeps expanding rather than deepening. Most creators find their niche and optimize it. Brittany treats every platform as a new playground.

The timeline tells the story:

**2019-2020:** TikTok content creator, signed to talent management, appeared in Sabra hummus Super Bowl ad, moved to LA with fellow TikToker Sarah Schauer

**2021:** Hosted TikTok's official podcast "For You"

**2022-2023:** Co-hosted "Violating Community Guidelines" podcast with Sarah Schauer (ended abruptly in December 2023)

**2023-present:** Launched "The Broski Report" solo podcast (reached #4 on Spotify's USA Top Podcasts, now over 1 million YouTube followers)

**2023-present:** Created "Royal Court" YouTube interview show featuring celebrities in medieval-themed setting (now 800,000+ subscribers)

**2025:** Released debut single "The Sun" and cover of [Harry Styles](/personality-analysis/Harry-Styles)' "Adore You," followed by second single "Stained," announced concept album in development

**2025:** Named to inaugural TIME100 Creators list in the Entertainers category

Each expansion follows classic Type 7 logic. Once a format feels mastered or limiting, it's time to try something new.

### The Sarah Schauer Chapter

When Brittany moved to LA in December 2019, she moved with fellow TikToker Sarah Schauer. The two became inseparable, making YouTube videos together and eventually launching "Violating Community Guidelines" in January 2022.

The podcast explored the internet's weirdest corners (firearm sales on Facebook Marketplace, AI influencers, deep fakes) with the chemistry of two friends who genuinely enjoyed each other's company. It reached impressive numbers and solidified their status as a comedy duo.

Then in December 2023, things ended abruptly.

They uploaded a "Series Finale" episode, and fans were left without explanation. Sarah hinted on Instagram Story that the decision was "out of her and Broski's hands" and that she was "upset but there was nothing I could do."

Neither has publicly confirmed what happened between them. They went their separate ways.

From a Type 7 perspective, this silence is notable. Type 7s typically reframe pain into content, but some things stay private. Whatever happened, Brittany has chosen not to process it publicly. A rare instance of a boundary in an otherwise open life.

### The Royal Court Vision

"Royal Court" represents Brittany at her most strategically Type 7. She looked at the crowded landscape of celebrity interview shows and thought: what if instead of imitating Hot Ones, I dressed in elaborate royal costumes and created an entirely different vibe?

**"I didn't want to make just another celebrity podcast,"** she explained. **"I wanted to combine Game of Thrones with Hot Ones. Sean Evans is able to make these celebrities feel like real people. You get them down to this level where they're dying from spicy wings and you don't see the celebrity. You see the person."**

The show started in her spare bedroom. Now in its third season, it features guests like Charli XCX, [Saoirse Ronan](/personality-analysis/Saoirse-Ronan), [Hozier](/personality-analysis/Hozier), Brie Larson, Kyle MacLachlan, Paul Mescal, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph. Nearly 6 million people have watched the Cole Sprouse episode alone.

When Paul Mescal appeared in November 2025, Brittany called it a dream fulfilled. He'd been at the top of her wish list since the show's inception. She flew to London to recreate her Royal Court set for the interview.

**"By the end of the episode we were giggling like little girls,"** she said. **"A big goal of mine is to keep legitimizing 'Royal Court' because I still feel like with old Hollywood, there's this snooty attitude sometimes towards content creators. It's a new version of the same job, and it's just as legitimate as any of the traditional white guy late night hosts."**

## Brittany's Mind: Etymology, Knitting, and Controlled Chaos

### The Hyperfixation Pattern

**"My current hyperfixations include etymology, knitting, and watching TikTok lives,"** Brittany once listed.

Most people have hobbies. Type 7s have obsessions that rotate. They dive deep into something, extract maximum stimulation, then shift to the next thing before boredom sets in. The word "hyperfixation" (borrowed from ADHD vocabulary) describes exactly how Type 7s engage with interests.

The etymology obsession is telling. Understanding where words come from satisfies the Type 7 need for depth without requiring emotional processing. It's intellectually stimulating, endlessly expandable, and provides interesting content for her podcast.

There's also the mobile game addiction she's joked about, spending "alarming" amounts on Cake Sort. And the Renaissance Faire passion she unpacked in detail on Theo Von's podcast (Episode 490 of "This Past Weekend," March 2024). And the deep dive into Irish men on premium dating apps.

That Theo Von episode is worth noting as a crossover moment. Over two hours, they covered: growing up as an Air Force kid in South Korea, her terrible job as an insurance agent, the TikTok blowup, problematic McDonald's characters (Uncle O'Grimacey got extensive discussion), her departure from the Baptist and Pentecostal churches, and an Irish man she met on a Christian dating app while in Nashville. It was the kind of long-form conversation that revealed dimensions her shorter content can't capture.

### Authenticity as Strategy

Brittany has built her brand on being genuinely weird. Not calculated weird. Actually weird.

Her friends Drew Afualo and Caleb Hearon share this commitment to genuine presence. The trio has become a defining feature of her social world. Drew appeared on Royal Court and was knighted as a "Knight of the Realm of Broski Nation." They've collaborated across multiple podcasts.

Caleb has said: **"If Drew and Brittany left the internet forever tomorrow, I'd still want to hang out with them every week... They are just two of the most lovely, brilliant, down-to-earth people. I could honestly cry talking about how lucky I am to have met them and to be their friend."**

For Type 7s, authenticity serves a dual purpose. It creates connection (which feels stimulating and positive) while also reducing the cognitive load of maintaining a fake persona. The "Broski Nation" fanbase responds to this realness because it gives them permission to be equally unfiltered.

### How She Actually Makes Content

The chaos isn't an act, but it's not entirely unstructured either.

Brittany's content process leans heavily on her improv background. The Broski Report has "no structure" by her own admission. She picks a loose topic and lets her mind wander. The tangents that feel spontaneous _are_ spontaneous. But she also does research on topics she cares about, weaving personal experience with genuine knowledge.

For Royal Court, there's more preparation. The medieval costumes don't arrange themselves, and she clearly researches her guests. But the conversations stay loose. The goal is getting celebrities to drop their guard, not hitting scripted beats.

She uploads multiple short videos daily, sometimes using a secondary "spam account" for less polished content. This volume isn't strategy. It's how a Type 7 mind naturally operates. The moment something seems interesting, it becomes content.

TIME100 recognized this approach specifically: Brittany was honored for "sustaining influence through authentic, unscripted content amid evolving social media."

**"Relatability is rewarded,"** Brittany has observed, **"but at what cost? Because now I'm sharing so many personal details about myself with six million people, who can in turn, weaponize that and use it against me."**

This reveals the Type 7's growing awareness of vulnerability costs. The very openness that creates connection also creates exposure.

### "Broski Nation" and Parasocial Reciprocity

In a September 2025 Bustle interview, Brittany made a striking admission about her relationship with her audience:

**"Broski Nation is why I do this sh*t. I am as parasocially attached to them as they are to me... I know the power of a community and finding someone online who you just f*cking love, so I try to be really thoughtful and careful with that."**

Unusual language for a creator. She's not just acknowledging that fans feel connected to her. She feels equally connected to them. This reflects the Type 7w6's deep need for belonging and mutual loyalty. The enthusiasm isn't just broadcast. It's a two-way street of genuine attachment.

### The Social Media Critique

Brittany doesn't just use social media. She analyzes it like a cultural critic. She's compared the dopamine hits from likes and interactions to addiction. She's criticized how platforms exploit human psychology to keep users engaged.

**"I find myself critiquing the compulsive tendencies where individuals reshape themselves into brands to cater to their following and algorithmic preferences, risking their authentic identity,"** she's shared.

This meta-awareness is unusual for Type 7s, who typically avoid uncomfortable analysis. It suggests Brittany is accessing her growth direction toward [Type 5](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-5), integrating more depth and reflection into her natural enthusiasm.

On what will last in the creator economy, she's been direct: **"Authenticity and reliability. Those words are so overused and so bastardized, but it doesn't take away from the core meaning."**

## The Self-Promotion Paradox

One of Brittany's most revealing admissions came in her Hollywood Reporter "Person of Interest" feature. When discussing the challenges of being a content creator, she explained the unique vulnerability of self-promotion:

When singers or actors promote their work, they're promoting a product they created. But when Brittany self-promotes, **"it's me."** If someone criticizes the project, **"they didn't like me and what I was showing to the world."**

This reveals the Type 7's hidden insecurity. The exuberant persona isn't armor. It's exposed surface. Every piece of content is a piece of self put forward for judgment.

**"It was difficult at first,"** she admitted. **"I'm such a people pleaser, I'm a Taurus. It's hard to change everything about yourself immediately so that people will like you and that's just a never-ending spiral."**

But she's found her footing: **"I genuinely don't care if you don't like me because I know my worth."**

## The Health Journey: When Type 7 Meets Type 1

In 2024, Brittany publicly documented her PCOS diagnosis and subsequent health transformation. She lost 27 pounds through medical treatment (Metformin and Semaglutide), dietary changes, and consistent exercise.

**"Body by my PCOS doctor who actually cares if I live or die,"** she posted, characteristically turning a medical journey into relatable content.

But the health journey reveals something deeper about Type 7 stress patterns. When Type 7s are overwhelmed, they move toward [Type 1](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-1), the Perfectionist. Suddenly the enthusiastic person who resists routine becomes rigid, self-critical, and focused on "doing things right."

Brittany's discussions of seasonal depression, therapy experiences, and diet modifications show this stress pattern playing out. The Type 7 who naturally avoids pain was forced to confront physical symptoms that couldn't be escaped through distraction.

**"I suspect that my diet and hormonal issues may be factors contributing to my mood swings and seasonal depression,"** she's analyzed. This kind of systematic self-examination is Type 1 territory. It's not comfortable for a Type 7.

The positive outcome: she developed what she calls "safety systems," ways to honor her body's needs without losing her spontaneous spirit. The weight loss became not just physical transformation but proof that she could integrate discipline without losing herself.

## The "Lover Girl" and Irish Adventures

Brittany has been open about her dating life on The Broski Report, turning romantic experiences into characteristically entertaining content.

She self-identifies as a **"lover girl,"** someone unafraid to show affection, but acknowledges the need to protect herself from becoming too invested too quickly. Classic Type 7 romantic pattern: enthusiastic engagement paired with self-awareness about vulnerability.

In early 2024, she shared her foray into online dating using a premium app set to Dublin, matching with Irish men and sharing comedic conversations. She was planning a trip to Ireland partly for a [Hozier](/personality-analysis/Hozier) concert and potentially to arrange meetups.

Then came the episode titled "I Have Horrible News," where she revealed she'd been ghosted by the Irishman she'd been talking to. True to Type 7 form, she maintained a light-hearted tone, jesting about a hypothetical future with her once-potential partner.

(There's also a running joke on The Broski Report about being "officially in love" with Hozier and expected to move to Ireland "any day now." This is comedic content, not actual relationship news.)

Her debut single "The Sun" came from a similarly vulnerable place:

**"I was coming off of a situationship... I have done all of the work on myself, I am intelligent, funny, successful... What do you mean I'm not good enough?"**

This reveals the Type 7's hidden sensitivity to rejection beneath the confident exterior. The pain didn't paralyze her. It became art.

## Music Career: From Theater Kid to Recording Artist

### "The Sun" and "Stained"

In March 2025, Brittany released her first official piece of music, a cover of Harry Styles' "Adore You." Then in April came her debut original single "The Sun," co-written with Luke Niccoli (who's worked with Carly Rae Jepsen and The Kid LAROI).

She described it as **"ethereal, whimsical, but also at the core of it, a stink face bluesy rock song."**

Critics praised it as evidence that the influencer-to-artist pipeline doesn't have to be cringe. The Harvard Crimson called it a "redemption" of the entire genre.

Her second single "Stained" followed in May 2025, produced by Zhone (Kesha, Troye Sivan) and co-written with Annika Bennett ([Chappell Roan](/personality-analysis/Chappell-Roan), Lauv). The song slowly builds to her powerful vocals on the chorus.

**"I wanted to capture the feeling of being forever marked by a relationship,"** Brittany explained. **"Whether or not it's something you particularly want to remember is irrelevant. It is and always will be... on you."**

Her musical influences (Hozier, Florence and the Machine, Mumford and Sons, The Beatles, One Direction) represent her most personal creative expression yet. Music was always the underlying dream, even as comedy content paid the bills.

**"I grew up in the church and always gravitated towards bluesy rock-and-roll music from the '50s and '60s,"** she's explained. The concept album she's developing represents a Type 7 reaching for deeper creative expression rather than just broader expansion.

## Current Work and Recognition

In July 2025, Brittany was named to the inaugural TIME100 Creators list in the Entertainers category. Recognition of how she's sustained influence beyond her initial viral moment. The honor placed her alongside creators like Khabane Lame, Jake Shane, and Hannah Berner.

Now 28, Brittany has amassed over 7.6 million followers on TikTok and another 4.6 million across YouTube and Instagram.

Season three of Royal Court premiered in Fall 2025 with guests including Noah Cyrus, Brie Larson, Fred Armisen, Finn Wolfhard, Josh Hutcherson, Paul Mescal, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Jessie Buckley, and Rachel Sennott. Her goal remains establishing Royal Court as an **"absolutely necessary press stop for anyone promoting anything."** A millennial-coded late-night talk show for the YouTube generation.

The Broski Report continues as her most direct connection to Broski Nation, released every Tuesday. The range of topics is genuinely dizzying: Victorian fun facts. The Seven Deadly Sins reinterpreted with comedic flair. Her obsession with actor Jack O'Connell. WWII deep dives. Wuthering Heights book club. Studio Ghibli analysis. The "age of brainrot." Hedonism as philosophy. Chernobyl. Wattpad culture.

The podcast has no structure by design. She starts somewhere and follows her curiosity. It's what distinguishes her from podcasters who stay in their lane.

Brittany doesn't have a lane. She has an open field.

## Understanding Brittany's Type 7 Mind

What makes Brittany Broski compelling isn't just her enthusiasm. It's her willingness to show the anxiety underneath it.

The Type 7 fear of being trapped in pain is real. The coping mechanism of constant stimulation and humor is real. But so is her growing capacity to sit with difficult emotions rather than immediately reframing them.

**"The depth of perceptions contributes to existential struggles and mental health challenges,"** she's reflected on her podcast. She advocates for viewing mental health issues with empathy rather than romanticizing the "tortured artist" trope.

This represents integrated Type 7 wisdom: acknowledging that the brightness and the darkness both exist, that the enthusiasm doesn't erase the anxiety, that authentic connection requires showing both.

---

Brittany Broski turned an 8-second kombucha reaction into a multi-platform career by being genuinely herself. Scattered interests. Anxious energy. Bluegrass heart. Religious trauma. Irish romantic adventures. All of it.

Her Type 7 psychology drives the constant expansion, the enthusiasm overflow, the instinct to transform pain into content. But her growth shows someone learning that depth and stillness aren't the enemies of joy.

As she told her audience: **"Nobody's got you like your girls got you. CHERISH YOUR GIRLS!"**
