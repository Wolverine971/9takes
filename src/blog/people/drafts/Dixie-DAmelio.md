> "I just feel guilty for being alive sometimes, for something I can't control."

<p class="firstLetter">That's not the kind of thing you expect from someone with 35 million TikTok followers. But Dixie D'Amelio isn't what she appears to be. Behind the sarcastic humor and deadpan delivery is someone who spent her entire rise to fame questioning whether she deserved any of it.</p>

While her younger sister Charli became TikTok's golden child, Dixie carved out a different path. Not the polished performer. Not the natural star. Something messier, more complicated, and far more revealing about what fame actually does to a person.

## What is Dixie D'Amelio's Personality Type?

### Dixie D'Amelio is an Enneagram Type 4

[Enneagram Type 4s](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-4) are called "The Individualist" for a reason. They're driven by a deep need to understand themselves and find their unique identity. The catch: they often feel like that identity is fundamentally flawed. Like everyone else got an instruction manual for life that they somehow missed.

Type 4s experience emotions more intensely than most. Where others feel disappointed, a 4 feels devastated. Where others feel happy, a 4 wonders why they can't feel _that_ happy. This creates a constant sense of longing, a feeling that something essential is missing.

The Type 4's childhood wound typically involves feeling different or overlooked. They grow up sensing they don't quite fit in their family system, leading to a lifelong search for their "true self."

For Dixie, this plays out in her relationship with Charli, her struggles with mental health, and her use of music as emotional processing. She doesn't just create content. She works through her existence via content.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Upbringing: The Other Sister

Dixie Jane D'Amelio was born on August 12, 2001, in Norwalk, Connecticut. Her father Marc ran for Connecticut State Senate as a Republican and worked in the apparel industry. Her mother Heidi was a model turned personal trainer. On paper, an all-American suburban upbringing.

But the sibling dynamic was complicated long before TikTok existed.

"We hated each other, like absolutely hated each other," Dixie revealed on The Drew Barrymore Show. "All of middle school, until we got into high school together."

Three years older than Charli, Dixie was entering high school while her sister was still in middle school. Different worlds. Different friend groups. Different pressures. The sisters would go weeks without speaking. Not from busy schedules. From genuine disconnection.

Dixie told the Madhappy podcast that a "competition of mental health" prevented them from truly understanding each other. They were both struggling, but neither knew how to reach across the divide.

When Charli started attending the same high school, something clicked. "Then we became best friends," Dixie explained. "She would come with me to every party on the weekend. It just came out of nowhere."

But before that reconciliation came sophomore year. And everything fell apart.

### The Breaking Point

During her sophomore year, Dixie's anxiety became so severe that she developed Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES), her body's physical response to psychological distress. She describes feeling "shaky" in class one day, asking a friend to help her walk to her mother's car, then falling to the ground in a seizure.

She was hospitalized. Put on five months of bed rest. Transferred schools. Developed a stutter. Couldn't have normal conversations anymore.

"I was a person when I was at my old school who I did not like," Dixie later shared. "I was not myself, because I had so much anxiety and everything going through my brain at the time where I couldn't even have a proper conversation with anyone."

Feeling fundamentally broken. Watching others live normal lives while you can't access that same ease. This happened before she had any followers to blame it on.

### Parents Who Didn't Understand (At First)

Marc and Heidi D'Amelio didn't initially know how to help their daughter.

"I've been dealing with things my whole life with mental health," Dixie explained on The D'Amelio Show. "It wasn't easy. It was even harder to try to explain to my parents who just didn't get it. They didn't understand mental health."

That generational gap is common. For older generations, mental health wasn't discussed openly. You pushed through. You didn't talk about feeling like you wanted to disappear.

Credit to Marc and Heidi: they recognized their limits. As Heidi put it: "This is bigger than what we know what to do as parents. I'm not going to try to fix my car because I don't know how. I'm going to take it to a professional. And I feel like the same about therapy or mental health."

They took Dixie to doctors. They sat beside her during panic attacks that were later filmed for the reality show. They learned alongside her.

"With my parents' help and them taking me to doctors and making sure I'm eating the right food and working out and just having them to talk to has been so helpful," Dixie shared. "It really helped to start my journey in a positive way."

## Dixie D'Amelio's Rise to Fame: Second Place by Default

Dixie didn't seek TikTok fame. She was already on Instagram when Charli started posting dance videos in late 2019. When Charli exploded to become the most-followed person on TikTok, Dixie got pulled into the slipstream.

She became famous for being Charli's sister.

For a Type 4 already struggling with identity, this was both opportunity and crisis. How do you find yourself when the world only sees you as an extension of someone else?

Dixie's approach: lean into what made her different. While Charli perfected choreography, Dixie posted deadpan humor and sarcastic commentary. While Charli stayed carefully polished, Dixie showed her rough edges.

"With Charli and I, we never really had competition, because I would always do my own thing and she would always do hers," Dixie explained. But the comparison was inevitable. For someone prone to envy and self-doubt, it cut deep.

### The Music Pivot

In June 2020, before signing any deal, Dixie released her debut single "Be Happy." The song wasn't typical pop. It was a surprisingly honest exploration of depression that resonated with millions.

The production is intentionally upbeat and peppy, creating an ironic contrast with lyrics about not being able to feel happy. That juxtaposition, hiding darkness beneath a bright surface, felt authentic to how many young people actually cope.

By August 2020, she'd signed with L.A. Reid's HitCo Entertainment. "Be Happy" hit the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, accumulated over 100 million YouTube views, and earned RIAA Gold certification.

What followed was deliberate emotional exploration:

- **"One Whole Day" (with Wiz Khalifa)** tackled overthinking and spiral thoughts
- **"Psycho" (featuring Rubi Rose)** peaked at No. 25 on US pop charts, embracing the "crazy" label people assign to emotional women
- **"F\*\*\*boy"** was a direct response to relationship drama, released during her messy breakup period

In June 2022, she dropped her debut album "A Letter to Me," 15 tracks created with Jenna Andrews and Stephen Kirk (who produced BTS's "Butter"). One standout: "Who I Am" features a voicemail from her grandmother. "My Grandmother has been such a huge influence on me growing up," Dixie explained.

But she was honest about the process: "The first album was a very commercial experience for me. I did everything the way I was told, even if it was a cheesy breakup song."

That tension between authentic expression and industry demands is classic Type 4. The art wants to be personal. The business wants it palatable.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Relationships: Love in the Spotlight

### Griffin Johnson: The First Public Romance

In early 2020, Dixie started dating Griffin Johnson, a TikTok star and Sway House member. Their chemistry sparked while filming _Attaway General_, where they played on-screen love interests.

Griffin officially asked Dixie to be his girlfriend in July 2020. One month later, they were done.

The breakup got messy fast. Chase Hudson (Charli's ex) publicly accused Griffin of cheating on Dixie with two girls. Griffin denied it, claiming he'd only "Snapchatted a girl." Dixie later posted receipts, what appeared to be an apology text from Griffin "owning up to it completely."

The drama played out across TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter. For someone already prone to emotional intensity, it was trial by fire.

Looking back in May 2021, Dixie dismissed the relationship: "It was just a dumb, immature relationship. We shouldn't have been dating in the first place. We were cooler as friends." By 2025, she'd made peace with it, reuniting with Griffin at a content house revival and calling it "really healing for everyone involved."

### Noah Beck: The Real Thing

While her relationship with Griffin was a TikTok soap opera, Noah Beck represented something different.

They first connected filming her "Be Happy" music video in September 2020. By October, they'd gone public. Noah confirmed to AwesomenessTV: "We're dating."

For two years, Dixie and Noah were TikTok's power couple. They documented their relationship on The D'Amelio Show, navigated public scrutiny, and seemed genuinely supportive of each other.

Then, in September 2022, Dixie revealed on the show that they'd split.

"We're not really talking right now," she said. "We've come to that conclusion that we just shouldn't talk for a little bit, but we're broken up."

Noah reflected later: "One of the best parts of the relationship was knowing that we were in it together, and we both just understood."

They reunited briefly at Coachella 2023, sparking rumors of reconciliation. As of 2025, Dixie appears to be single, focused on her career.

For a Type 4, relationships are intense. They're not just partnerships. They're mirrors for identity exploration. Both relationships taught Dixie something about who she was and who she wanted to become.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Personality: The Patterns Behind the Persona

### The Guilt Complex

"I just feel guilty for every single thing I do, for every opportunity I have," Dixie admitted on The D'Amelio Show. "I broke down the other day. I was like, 'Would I be doing more people a favor if I wasn't here?'"

This isn't attention-seeking. It's the Type 4's shadow: the deep belief that you're fundamentally unworthy, that your existence is somehow a burden. Type 4s often struggle with feeling like they take up space they don't deserve.

Dixie followed up: "I'm not trying to...for sympathy or anything, I just want to be real. That's how I'm feeling."

That need to be "real" while simultaneously fearing judgment is the Type 4 tightrope walk.

### The Humor as Defense

Watch any Dixie video and you'll notice the delivery: dry, deadpan, slightly detached. This isn't just a style choice. It's a coping mechanism.

"I'm using comedy to deal with my feelings," she admitted.

The problem? Sarcasm doesn't translate in 15-second clips.

"Some people say I might have like an attitude or like I'm rude and I get it because I do come off that way sometimes," Dixie explained on the Spout podcast, "but I'm very sarcastic."

The podcast host told her she was "so nice in person," calling her a "bright light," the opposite of her online persona. Dixie acknowledged the disconnect: "The problem I need to work on is my sense of humor is very sarcastic, which does not come across on the internet."

Type 4s often develop ironic or self-deprecating humor as armor. If you make fun of yourself first, no one else's criticism can hurt as much. The persona becomes a protective layer between the intensely feeling inner self and a harsh outside world.

But Dixie's armor keeps getting mistaken for aggression.

### The PMDD Diagnosis

In October 2022, Dixie revealed she'd been diagnosed with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), a severe form of PMS that causes extreme emotional and physical symptoms.

"Basically, extreme anxiety, depression, losing the will to live and a lot of irritability and anger," she described. "I didn't know that you weren't supposed to want to die every month before you got your period."

For someone already prone to emotional intensity, PMDD amplified everything. But the diagnosis also gave her something Type 4s often crave: an explanation, a framework for understanding why she felt so different from everyone else.

## Building an Empire Beyond Charli's Shadow

Despite her struggles, Dixie has built something separate from her sister.

She's the third highest-earning TikTok creator, behind only Addison Rae and Charli. Forbes named her the second highest-paid TikTok star in 2022 with $11.5 million in earnings. She co-founded Social Tourist, an apparel brand with Hollister. She and Charli launched Be Happy Snacks, which landed a distribution deal with 7-Eleven.

But the recent pivot tells the real story.

In September 2024, she signed with WME and IMG Models, signaling a serious move toward high fashion. She's walked for major houses. Appeared in campaigns for Balenciaga, Valentino, and Chopard. Made her Cannes Film Festival debut in 2024.

The D'Amelio Show was cancelled in 2024. Dixie explained it was a mutual decision: she wanted "to figure out how to balance my work life a little bit more."

Translation: she's choosing her own path now.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Controversies: When the Mask Slipped

### The Dinner Disaster (November 2020)

The D'Amelio family posted a YouTube video called "Dinner with the D'Amelios" featuring their personal chef. Dixie gagged at the food, ran outside to throw up when served escargot, and the internet erupted.

Critics called her ungrateful, entitled, bratty. Charli lost a million followers. The family was "canceled."

Dixie's response revealed her Type 4 processing: "The way I come across is bratty, ungrateful, things like that. At the end of the day, when you're unhappy with your own life, you don't care about anything."

She wasn't defending the behavior. She was trying to explain the internal state that led to it. Type 4 to the core: focusing on the emotional truth behind the action.

### The Trisha Paytas Fallout

During the dinner fallout, Trisha Paytas (a controversial YouTuber) piled on with criticism of the D'Amelio family. Dixie's response backfired spectacularly.

She posted a TikTok of herself dancing to a resurfaced audio clip of Trisha rapping the N-word, essentially using Trisha's past racism to deflect from her own criticism.

The internet wasn't having it. Dixie quickly apologized, acknowledging it was the wrong approach regardless of how hurt she felt. But the damage was done.

### The Pattern

These incidents reveal a Type 4 pattern: when attacked, the instinct is to expose the attacker's flaws rather than simply apologize. It's not strategic. It's emotional. The feeling is: "You think I'm bad? Look at what you've done."

But the internet doesn't grade on a curve.

### The Public Perception Struggle

"It just makes me feel like I don't deserve anything," Dixie said about online criticism. "I'm trying to do everything I can to better myself and it just gets worse."

The thing that stung most? The perceived double standard.

"Everyone else can show emotions and talk about things and everyone supports them, but anytime I talk about literal sh\*t I've been through it doesn't matter."

Type 4s often feel uniquely misunderstood. Their pain gets dismissed while others get sympathy for similar struggles. Whether or not that's accurate, it reinforces their sense of being different.

## Dixie D'Amelio Today: A Different Kind of Evolution

### The Sister Situation

She and Charli no longer live together. "They need their own space," Dixie explained on a livestream.

Recent speculation about a rift surfaced in May 2025. Dixie was noticeably absent from Charli's 21st birthday celebration in New York. She didn't post a public birthday message, despite doing so in 2024 for Charli's 20th. Fans noticed the sisters rarely appear on each other's Instagram anymore.

No confirmation of a falling out exists. Maybe they're simply living more independent lives with different social circles. But for two sisters whose entire public identity was built together, the distance is notable.

### What She Actually Does

Beyond the fashion campaigns, Dixie keeps busy with cooking (she's described herself as a foodie), gaming with cousins and close friends, and fitness following her mother's influence.

Her style evolution has been dramatic. She's tried long hair, short hair, platinum blond, a shaved head, and currently rocks a mullet. "When it comes to hair, I'm open to anything," she's said.

Her old friendships have shifted. She and Addison Rae were once inseparable. Fans noticed cooling in that friendship, speculating about drama. The Hype House and Sway House connections have faded as content houses became less central to TikTok culture.

Her pivot to fashion suggests she's building a different kind of network now.

### The Growth

The shift is notable. Early Dixie content was reactive: responding to hate, defending herself, processing pain publicly. Current Dixie seems more settled.

"Being able to focus on my mental health and feel better that way, I've seen such a huge change in my life and just how I am as a person," she shared. "I've seen the difference from when I'm mentally healthy versus not. When I'm healthy, I could read a comment and it doesn't mean anything to me."

That's Type 4 growth. Moving from overwhelming emotional reactivity toward something more grounded. The identity crisis doesn't disappear. It just becomes manageable.

## The Psychology of Sibling Shadow

What makes Dixie's story compelling isn't just the mental health struggles or the fame. It's the universal experience she represents: what happens when someone close to you becomes the main character, and you're cast as supporting?

Type 4s feel this dynamic hard because their identity is already shaky. Watching Charli succeed so effortlessly must have activated every insecurity Dixie already had about her own worth.

But here's what Dixie figured out: she didn't need to become a better version of Charli. She needed to become a more authentic version of herself.

The music, the dry humor, the unflinching honesty about mental health: these aren't failed attempts to compete with Charli. They're Dixie's way of saying "I'm something different entirely."

For Type 4s watching Dixie's journey, whether you relate more to [Billie Eilish's](/personality-analysis/Billie-Eilish) artistic intensity or [Madison Beer's](/personality-analysis/Madison-Beer) struggles with public perception, there's a lesson here. The thing that makes you feel defective might actually be the thing that makes you distinctive. The emotions that feel like too much might be the raw material for something meaningful.

Dixie D'Amelio didn't become famous for being Charli's sister. She became famous for being Charli's sister and then spent years publicly figuring out who else she could be.

The girl who couldn't have conversations in high school because of anxiety now sits for interviews with major magazines. The sister who hated Charli in middle school learned to love her. The person who felt fundamentally flawed found ways to frame those flaws as features.

Is she happy? Probably not consistently. Type 4s rarely are. Happiness isn't really the goal for them anyway. Authenticity is. And Dixie seems closer to that than she's ever been.

The question isn't whether she'll always struggle. She will. The question is whether she can keep building something meaningful despite it.

So far, the answer seems to be yes.
