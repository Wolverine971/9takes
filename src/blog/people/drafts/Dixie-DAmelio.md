> "I just feel guilty for being alive sometimes, for something I can't control."

<p class="firstLetter">That's not the kind of thing you expect to hear from someone with 35 million TikTok followers. But Dixie D'Amelio isn't what she appears to be. Behind the sarcastic humor and deadpan delivery lies someone who has spent her entire rise to fame questioning whether she deserves any of it—and wrestling with an identity crisis that fame only amplified.</p>

While her younger sister Charli became TikTok's golden child, Dixie carved out a different path. Not the polished performer. Not the natural star. Something messier, more complicated, and far more interesting.

<ul>
<li><b>Identity through contrast:</b> Dixie has always defined herself in opposition to her sister—the "other" D'Amelio, the older one who didn't dance, the one who went viral second. This search for a unique identity separate from Charli is classic Type 4.</li>

## What is Dixie D'Amelio's Personality Type?

### Dixie D'Amelio is an Enneagram Type 4

[Enneagram Type 4s](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-4) are called "The Individualist" for a reason. They're driven by a deep need to understand themselves and find their unique identity. But here's the catch—they often feel like that identity is fundamentally flawed, like everyone else got an instruction manual for life that they somehow missed.

Type 4s experience emotions more intensely than most. Where others might feel disappointed, a Type 4 feels devastated. Where others feel happy, a Type 4 might wonder why they can't feel _that_ happy. This creates a constant sense of longing—a feeling that something essential is missing.

The Type 4's childhood wound typically involves feeling different or overlooked. They often grew up feeling like they didn't quite fit in their family system, leading to a lifelong search for their "true self."

For Dixie, this plays out in her relationship with Charli, her struggles with mental health, and her use of music as emotional expression. She doesn't just create content. She processes her existence through it.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Upbringing: The Other Sister

Dixie Jane D'Amelio was born on August 12, 2001, in Norwalk, Connecticut. Her father Marc ran for Connecticut State Senate as a Republican and worked in the apparel industry. Her mother Heidi was a model turned personal trainer. On paper, it was an all-American suburban upbringing.

But even before TikTok existed, the sibling dynamic was complicated.

"We didn't talk at all really," Dixie revealed about her relationship with Charli growing up. "When I say not talk, I mean like actually not talk for days, weeks."

Three years older than Charli, Dixie was entering high school while her sister was still in middle school. Different worlds. Different friend groups. Different pressures.

Then came sophomore year, and everything fell apart.

### The Breaking Point

During her sophomore year, Dixie's anxiety became so severe that she developed Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES)—her body's physical response to psychological distress. She describes feeling "shaky" in class one day, asking a friend to help her walk to her mother's car, then falling to the ground in a seizure.

She was hospitalized. Put on five months of bed rest. Transferred schools. Developed a stutter. Couldn't have normal conversations anymore.

"I was a person when I was at my old school who I did not like," Dixie later shared. "I was not myself, because I had so much anxiety and everything going through my brain at the time where I couldn't even have a proper conversation with anyone."

That's the Type 4 experience right there. Feeling fundamentally broken. Watching others live normal lives while you can't access that same ease. And this happened before she had any followers to blame it on.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Rise to Fame: Second Place by Default

Here's the thing about Dixie's rise to TikTok fame: she didn't seek it. She was already on Instagram when Charli started posting dance videos in late 2019. When Charli exploded to become the most-followed person on TikTok, Dixie got pulled into the slipstream.

She became famous for being Charli's sister.

For a Type 4 who already struggled with identity, this was both an opportunity and a crisis. How do you find yourself when the world only sees you as an extension of someone else?

Dixie's approach was to lean into what made her different. While Charli perfected choreography, Dixie posted deadpan humor and sarcastic commentary. While Charli stayed carefully polished, Dixie showed her rough edges.

"With Charli and I, we never really had competition, because I would always do my own thing and she would always do hers," Dixie explained. But the comparison was inevitable—and for someone prone to envy and self-doubt, it cut deep.

### The Music Pivot

In August 2020, Dixie signed with L.A. Reid's HitCo Entertainment. Her debut single "Be Happy" wasn't a typical pop track—it was a surprisingly honest exploration of depression that resonated with millions.

The song hit the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and accumulated over 55 million Spotify streams. Collaborations with Wiz Khalifa and Liam Payne followed. In 2022, she released her debut album "A Letter to Me" and opened for Big Time Rush on their Forever Tour.

But Dixie was honest about the process: "The first album was a very commercial experience for me. I did everything the way I was told, even if it was a cheesy breakup song."

The struggle between authentic expression and industry demands played out publicly in her discography. Type 4s know that tension well.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Personality: The Patterns Behind the Persona

### The Guilt Complex

"I just feel guilty for every single thing I do, for every opportunity I have," Dixie admitted on The D'Amelio Show. "I broke down the other day. I was like, 'Would I be doing more people a favor if I wasn't here?'"

This isn't attention-seeking. It's the Type 4's shadow—the deep belief that you're fundamentally unworthy, that your existence is somehow a burden. Type 4s often struggle with feeling like they take up space they don't deserve.

Dixie followed up: "I'm not trying to...for sympathy or anything, I just want to be real. That's how I'm feeling."

That need to be "real" while simultaneously fearing judgment is the Type 4 tightrope walk.

### The Humor as Defense

Watch any Dixie video and you'll notice the delivery—dry, deadpan, slightly detached. This isn't just a style choice. It's a coping mechanism.

"I'm using comedy to deal with my feelings," she admitted.

Type 4s often develop ironic or self-deprecating humor as armor. If you make fun of yourself first, no one else's criticism can hurt as much. The persona becomes a protective layer between the intensely feeling inner self and the harsh outside world.

### The PMDD Diagnosis

In October 2022, Dixie revealed she'd been diagnosed with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)—a severe form of PMS that causes extreme emotional and physical symptoms.

"Basically, extreme anxiety, depression, losing the will to live and a lot of irritability and anger," she described her symptoms. "I didn't know that you weren't supposed to want to die every month before you got your period."

For someone already prone to emotional intensity, PMDD amplified everything. But the diagnosis also gave her something Type 4s often crave—an explanation, a framework for understanding why she felt so different from everyone else.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Accomplishments: More Than Charli's Sister

Despite her struggles, Dixie has built an empire separate from her sister:

### Business Ventures

Beyond TikTok, Dixie co-founded Social Tourist, an apparel brand with Hollister. She and Charli launched Be Happy Snacks, which landed a distribution deal with 7-Eleven. The family started 444 Capital, a $25 million investment fund.

She's the third highest-earning TikTok creator, behind only Addison Rae and Charli. Forbes named her the second highest-paid TikTok star in 2022 with $11.5 million in earnings.

### Fashion and Entertainment

Dixie has walked for major fashion houses and appeared in campaigns for Balenciaga, Valentino, and Chopard. In September 2024, she signed with WME and IMG Models, signaling a pivot toward high fashion.

She made her Cannes Film Festival debut in 2024 and starred in three seasons of The D'Amelio Show on Hulu. The show's 2024 cancellation, she explained, was a mutual decision—she wanted "to figure out how to balance my work life a little bit more."

### Awards and Recognition

She won a Kids' Choice Award in 2022 for Favorite Musical Star. Billboard ranked her No. 18 on their 2020 Emerging Artists chart.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Controversies: When the Mask Slipped

### The Dinner Disaster

In November 2020, the D'Amelio family posted a YouTube video called "Dinner with the D'Amelios." Dixie gagged at the food, ran outside to throw up when served escargot, and the internet erupted.

Critics called her ungrateful, entitled, bratty. Charli lost a million followers. The family was "canceled."

Dixie's response revealed her Type 4 processing: "The way I come across is bratty, ungrateful, things like that. At the end of the day, when you're unhappy with your own life, you don't care about anything."

She wasn't defending the behavior. She was trying to explain the internal state that led to it. That's Type 4 to the core: focusing on the emotional truth behind the action.

### The Public Perception Struggle

"It just makes me feel like I don't deserve anything," Dixie said about online criticism. "I'm trying to do everything I can to better myself and it just gets worse."

The thing that stung most? The perceived double standard.

"Everyone else can show emotions and talk about things and everyone supports them, but anytime I talk about literal sh\*t I've been through it doesn't matter."

Type 4s often feel uniquely misunderstood. Their pain gets dismissed while others get sympathy for similar struggles. Whether or not that's accurate, it reinforces their sense of being different.

## Dixie D'Amelio's Legacy: Finding Herself

### Current Focus

As of 2025, Dixie has stepped back from music and reality TV to focus on modeling and fashion. She attended Milan Fashion Week in September 2024 and Paris Fashion Week in October 2025. The Balenciaga "Le City" bag campaign featured her prominently.

She and Charli no longer live together, though they remain close. Recent speculation about a rift—Dixie was noticeably absent from Charli's 21st birthday celebration in May 2025—remains unconfirmed.

### The Growth Journey

The shift is notable. Early Dixie content was reactive—responding to hate, defending herself, processing pain publicly. Current Dixie seems more settled.

"Being able to focus on my mental health and feel better that way, I've seen such a huge change in my life and just how I am as a person," she shared. "I've seen the difference from when I'm mentally healthy versus not. When I'm healthy, I could read a comment and it doesn't mean anything to me."

That's Type 4 growth. Moving from overwhelming emotional reactivity toward something more grounded. The identity crisis doesn't disappear. It just becomes manageable.

## The Psychology of Sibling Shadow

What makes Dixie's story compelling isn't just the mental health struggles or the fame. It's the universal experience she represents: What happens when someone close to you becomes the main character, and you're cast as supporting?

Type 4s feel this dynamic hard because their identity is already shaky. Watching Charli succeed so effortlessly? That must have activated every insecurity Dixie already had about her own worth.

But here's what Dixie figured out: she didn't need to become a better version of Charli. She needed to become a more authentic version of herself.

The music, the dry humor, the unflinching honesty about mental health—these aren't failed attempts to compete with Charli. They're Dixie's way of saying "I'm something different entirely."

For Type 4s watching Dixie's journey—whether you relate more to [Billie Eilish's](/personality-analysis/Billie-Eilish) artistic intensity or [Madison Beer's](/personality-analysis/Madison-Beer) struggles with public perception—there's a lesson here. The thing that makes you feel defective might actually be the thing that makes you distinctive. The emotions that feel like too much might be the raw material for something meaningful.

Dixie D'Amelio didn't become famous for being Charli's sister. She became famous for being Charli's sister and then spent years publicly figuring out who else she could be.

That's not a story of second place. That's a story of someone finding first place in their own lane.

What would you discover about yourself if you stopped comparing and started exploring? If you could see your "flaws" as features, what would become possible?
