## What is George H.W. Bush's Personality Type?

### George H.W. Bush is an Enneagram Type 6 (The Loyalist)

Type 6 individuals are defined by their fundamental desire for security and support. They are the alliance-builders of the Enneagram, naturally inclined to create networks of trust that can weather any storm. At their best, they are courageous, responsible, and deeply committed. At their worst, they can become anxious, suspicious, and paralyzed by doubt.

Bush exemplified the healthiest expressions of Type 6 energy: the dutiful public servant who put country before self, the coalition-builder who understood that lasting security comes through partnerships, and the devoted family man who prioritized relationships above ambition.

His mother Dorothy's famous rule against boasting—"I don't want to hear any more about the Great I Am"—perfectly captures how Type 6 humility was instilled in him from childhood. Where other personality types might announce their accomplishments, Bush deflected credit and emphasized teamwork.

## George H.W. Bush's Upbringing: The Making of a Loyalist

### Privilege with Purpose

George Herbert Walker Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, into one of America's most prominent families. His father, Prescott Bush, was a Wall Street investment banker at Brown Brothers Harriman and would later serve as a U.S. Senator from Connecticut. His maternal grandfather, George Herbert Walker, was a successful financier whose fortune provided the family's considerable wealth.

The family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, when George was a young boy, and he grew up largely unaffected by the Great Depression due to the family's financial security. But this privilege came with strict expectations.

### The Lessons of Duty and Modesty

At Greenwich Country Day School, boasting was considered "the boorish behavior of parvenus." Students were graded not only in academics but in a category called "Claims no more than his fair share of time and attention." Young "Poppy" Bush absorbed these lessons completely.

His mother Dorothy reinforced this at home with remarkable consistency. When a Bush child burst in to announce hitting a home run, she would sweetly ask, "How did the team do, dear?" Years later, as Vice President, Bush received phone calls from his then-86-year-old mother telling him, "You're talking about yourself too much, George."

"It stuck," Bush later said of his mother's anti-boasting campaign. This explains both his genuine humility and the political liability it would later create.

### Father's Shadow and Model

Prescott Bush modeled public service as a sacred duty. He served as moderator of Greenwich town meetings for over 15 years before running for Senate, reportedly delaying his political ambitions until he had paid for his children's elite education. This pattern of patient service, of earning one's position through loyal work rather than self-promotion, would define George's entire career.

The Prescott Bush household taught that you serve institutions—you don't use them as stepping stones. You build coalitions—you don't go it alone. You keep your promises—even when it hurts.

## George H.W. Bush's Rise to Fame

### WWII: The Youngest Pilot's Courage

On his 18th birthday, immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy, Bush enlisted in the Navy as a seaman. Within a year, he was commissioned as an ensign and became one of the youngest naval aviators in American history.

His wartime service reveals the counterphobic courage that Type 6s can display when their values are at stake. On September 2, 1944, while flying a TBM Avenger torpedo bomber over the Japanese-held island of Chichi Jima, Bush's aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire. His engine caught fire.

What happened next defines the man: **Bush completed his attack run.** With flames engulfing his aircraft, he released his bombs on target, scoring several damaging hits, before finally bailing out over the ocean. His two crewmen were killed—one's parachute failed to open, the other went down with the plane. Bush spent four terrifying hours in an inflatable raft, with Japanese boats trying to capture him, before being rescued by the submarine USS Finback.

Over the course of 1944, Bush flew 58 combat missions while his squadron suffered a 300% casualty rate among its pilots. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery, three Air Medals, and a Presidential Unit Citation.

### Love Letters and Lifetime Partnership

While at Phillips Academy, 17-year-old George met 16-year-old Barbara Pierce at a Christmas dance in Greenwich. He called her "the niftiest girl at the dance." She described him as "the most beautiful creature I ever laid eyes on."

Since they attended different schools, they kept in touch through letters—a practice they would continue for the next 77 years. During his Navy service, Bush named his torpedo bombers after Barbara, christening the aircraft "Barbara III."

Six months into his military service, they were engaged. In a letter to his "Darling Bar," he wrote: "You have made my life full of everything I could even dream of—my complete happiness should be a token of my love for you."

They married on January 6, 1945, shortly after Bush returned from the Pacific. The marriage lasted 73 years—the second longest in presidential history—and produced six children: George, Robin, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.

"I married the first man I ever kissed," Barbara later told Time magazine. "When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up."

### Texas Oil: Breaking Away (While Staying Connected)

After Yale, Bush made a decision that would shape his identity: he moved to Texas. His biographer Jon Meacham notes this allowed Bush to move out of "the daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker," while still being able to "call on their connections if he needed to raise capital."

This is classic Type 6 behavior—seeking independence while maintaining security networks. Bush started as an oil field equipment salesman, then co-founded Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company in Midland, Texas. In 1953, he co-founded Zapata Petroleum Corporation, named after the Marlon Brando film *Viva Zapata!*

During this period, Bush became deeply involved in civic activities—serving on committees for the Midland Exchange Club, the Community Theater, and the American Cancer Society. He served as a ruling elder at First Presbyterian Church and even managed the local American Legion baseball team. The coalition-builder was already at work.

## George H.W. Bush's Personality: The Loyalist in Action

### The Mind of a Type 6 Leader

Type 6s approach the world through a lens of trust and security. They constantly assess: Who can be relied upon? What are the potential threats? How can we build stronger alliances?

Colin Powell captured Bush's leadership style perfectly: "He was competitive. If you tried to play horseshoes with him, you'd see how competitive he can be." Bush was so devoted to horseshoes that he had courts installed at the White House and Camp David. When Queen Elizabeth II visited in 1991, she brought him a silver-plated horseshoe set. In 1992, he hosted the Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins for a late-night horseshoe tournament—and threw a ringer to win.

But this competitiveness was always channeled through team-building. Bush's approach was never "I'll do it myself" but rather "Who should be on this team?"

### The Thousand Points of Light Philosophy

Bush's signature domestic initiative—the "Thousand Points of Light"—perfectly encapsulates Type 6 thinking. The phrase, introduced at the 1988 Republican National Convention, compared America's volunteer organizations to "a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky."

The underlying philosophy was pure Type 6: society's strength comes not from government alone, but from the interconnected networks of community organizations, churches, and volunteer groups that form a safety net of mutual support. During his presidency, Bush formally recognized more than 1,000 volunteers as "Points of Light," and created a foundation that continues today as the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.

"Any definition of a successful life includes service to others," Bush often said. His son would later eulogize him as "the brightest of the thousand points of light."

### The Loss That Never Left

In 1953, the Bushes faced every parent's nightmare. Their three-year-old daughter Robin was diagnosed with leukemia. At the time, the disease was poorly understood and almost always fatal.

For six months, Barbara and George flew Robin to New York for experimental treatments while keeping her diagnosis secret—as doctors advised—from their other children. When Robin died, George became the rock for his devastated wife.

"I was very close to her," Bush told ABC News decades later, still tearing up. "Normally I push it away, push it back."

Barbara credited George with saving her: "I crumbled completely, and he took care of me." This dynamic—the Type 6 becoming the reliable, steady presence in crisis—would characterize their entire marriage.

Sixty-five years later, the family reinterred Robin's remains at the Bush Presidential Library in Texas. "It seems funny after almost 50 years since her death how dear Robin is to our hearts," Bush said.

## Major Accomplishments: The Coalition-Builder's Legacy

### CIA Director: Rebuilding Trust

In January 1976, President Ford appointed Bush as Director of Central Intelligence—a position that required all of Bush's coalition-building skills. The CIA was in crisis. Watergate, Vietnam, and congressional investigations had devastated morale and public trust. Six different directors had served in ten years.

Bush was initially opposed by many who considered him too partisan for the job. He secured confirmation only after pledging not to run for president or vice president in 1976.

Once confirmed, Bush immediately set about rebuilding relationships. Being a former Congressman, he understood Capitol Hill's hostility toward the Agency. His clever strategy: hosting dinners at his home where CIA officers and their congressional critics could meet as human beings. The bridge-building worked.

"Despite being new to the Agency, he quickly identified with CIA's workforce," noted official CIA history. When he departed a year later (after Carter's election), Bush had restored the agency's morale. In 1999, CIA headquarters was renamed the George Bush Center for Intelligence—the only former president to have previously served as Director of Central Intelligence.

### The Gulf War Coalition: Type 6 at Its Finest

When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, Bush faced the defining test of his presidency. His response would become the textbook example of coalition warfare.

Rather than acting unilaterally, Bush assembled a coalition of 35 nations—the largest military alliance since World War II. He worked the phones relentlessly, calling world leaders personally, building consensus through relationships rather than ultimatums. The coalition included not just traditional allies like Britain and France, but Arab nations like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria.

Operation Desert Storm succeeded in just 42 days. Kuwait was liberated. Coalition casualties were minimal. And Bush made a decision that would prove controversial in retrospect but reflected his Type 6 prudence: he chose not to invade Baghdad and overthrow Saddam.

"I believed it would lead to an unstable Middle East," Bush later explained. He anticipated the chaos that would follow regime change—a chaos that would indeed materialize when [his son](/personality-analysis/George-W-Bush) invaded Iraq twelve years later.

This calculated restraint was quintessential Type 6 thinking: achieving the objective while avoiding the unintended consequences that come from overreaching.

### End of the Cold War: Quiet Competence

Bush's foreign policy achievements extend far beyond the Gulf War. He managed the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union with remarkable deftness, resisting pressure to gloat or humiliate the defeated superpower.

His approach was typically understated. "I've got to be careful not to be seen as doing things that [would] complicate the lives of the Soviets," he said. Rather than declaring victory, he focused on building relationships with emerging leaders like Boris Yeltsin and ensuring the transition was peaceful.

This quiet competence would become both his strength and his political weakness. Americans rarely saw the phone calls, the personal diplomacy, the careful coalition-building. They saw only the results—and sometimes wondered what Bush actually did.

## Controversies and Challenges: The Type 6's Dilemmas

### "Read My Lips: No New Taxes"

At the 1988 Republican National Convention, Bush delivered what would become the most consequential six words of his political career: "Read my lips: no new taxes."

The pledge was designed to address two problems. Conservatives doubted his commitment to [Reagan's](/personality-analysis/Ronald-Reagan) tax-cutting legacy. And the broader public had a nagging perception problem—the "wimp factor," as Newsweek had memorably labeled it.

For two years, the pledge held. Then came the 1990 budget crisis. The deficit was soaring. Democrats controlled Congress. Military operations in the Gulf were looming. Bush faced an impossible choice: keep his promise or address what he saw as a genuine threat to national security.

He chose to raise taxes.

"Yes, I wish like hell I had never said that," Bush later reflected, "because they could focus on the quote, rather than on how the economy was."

This decision reveals the Type 6's deepest conflict. Loyalty to his word clashed with loyalty to what he believed was best for the country. The pragmatic concern for stability won—but at devastating political cost.

Conservative supporters felt betrayed. Patrick Buchanan mounted a primary challenge in 1992. The broken promise became Exhibit A in the case against Bush's reelection.

### The Iran-Contra Shadow

The Iran-Contra scandal, which exploded in 1986, cast a long shadow over Bush's political career. The affair involved selling missiles to Iran (to secure hostage releases) and illegally funneling proceeds to Nicaraguan Contra rebels.

As Vice President, Bush participated in more than a dozen meetings where the weapons sales were discussed. He acknowledged some responsibility for the Iran arms deal. But he steadfastly maintained he knew nothing of the illegal money laundering for the Contras.

His most famous defense came in a combative 1988 interview with Dan Rather, where Bush aggressively pushed back against the suggestion he had lied about his knowledge.

Later, as president, Bush issued controversial pardons for six Reagan administration officials charged with Iran-Contra crimes—a decision that critics viewed as a cover-up and defenders saw as healing a national wound.

### The "Wimp Factor"

In October 1987, Newsweek published a cover story titled "George Bush: Fighting the 'Wimp Factor.'" The article captured a perception problem that had dogged Bush for years: that despite his resume—combat pilot, CIA director, Vice President—he somehow wasn't tough enough for the presidency.

The irony was bitter. Here was a man who had completed a bombing run with his plane on fire, who had led the CIA, who had stood up to world leaders. Yet his mother's lessons in modesty, his self-effacing style, his reluctance to use "I" sentences—all created an image of weakness.

Bush spent years trying to combat the perception. He ate pork rinds on the campaign trail. He was photographed in nuclear bombers. He sent joking memos calling himself "the pit bull of SDI."

But the wimp label never fully disappeared. His prudent approach to the Soviet collapse—celebrated by historians as masterful diplomacy—seemed passive to many Americans. His thoughtful deliberation appeared as indecision. His humility read as weakness.

Looking back, reporter Margaret Warner, who wrote the original "wimp" story, reflected: "We see qualities in George Bush that were not appreciated at the time—the modesty, the ability to reach out to the other side, to try to include everyone."

## George H.W. Bush's Legacy and Final Years

### The 1992 Defeat

Bush's reelection campaign in 1992 was, by his own admission, "lackluster." The broken tax pledge had fractured his conservative base. Patrick Buchanan's primary challenge wounded him. Ross Perot's independent candidacy split the anti-Clinton vote. And Bill Clinton hammered away at one message: "It's the economy, stupid."

Bush lost with 37.4% of the vote to Clinton's 43% and Perot's 19%.

The defeat stung deeply. But in typical Type 6 fashion, Bush handled the transition with grace, writing a famous note to Clinton: "You will be our President when you read this note... Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you."

### The Longest Goodbye

In his post-presidential years, Bush embraced causes that reflected his core values. He and Clinton—the man who defeated him—became unlikely friends, working together on disaster relief and humanitarian efforts. Their partnership symbolized Bush's ability to transcend partisan bitterness in service of larger goals.

Bush took up skydiving, making jumps on his 75th, 80th, 85th, and 90th birthdays. The man once called a wimp was jumping out of airplanes well into his tenth decade.

Barbara Bush died on April 17, 2018, at age 92. George was by her side, holding her hand, having told her "I love you, Barbie" as he did every night of their 73-year marriage.

George followed on November 30, 2018, at age 94. He was the longest-lived president in American history at the time of his death. His last words, spoken to his son George W., were "I love you, too."

He was buried beside Barbara and Robin at the Bush Presidential Library in Texas, reunited with the family he loved above all else.

### The Brightest Point of Light

At his state funeral, historian Jon Meacham offered the eulogy: "His life code, as he said, was 'tell the truth, don't blame people, be strong, do your best, try hard, forgive, stay the course.'"

George W. Bush, fighting back tears, closed his tribute to his father with words that captured the essence of the Type 6 devoted to service:

"He showed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity, leads with courage, and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country. And when the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush was a great president of the United States—a diplomat of unmatched skill, a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment, and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor... The best father a son or daughter could have. And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding Mom's hand again."

## Conclusion: The Loyalist's Lasting Lesson

George H.W. Bush's life offers a profound study in the strengths and vulnerabilities of the Type 6 personality. His coalition-building created security for nations. His loyalty sustained a 73-year marriage. His sense of duty drove him through combat, crisis, and the constant demands of public service.

But his very virtues created political liabilities. His humility looked like weakness. His prudence seemed like passivity. His willingness to compromise for the greater good cost him reelection.

Perhaps the deepest lesson of Bush's life is this: the qualities that make for genuine leadership—patience, coalition-building, principled compromise, humble service—are not always the qualities that win elections or earn immediate acclaim. History has been kinder to Bush than the voters of 1992.

What does it mean to build alliances in your own life? When has loyalty to a principle conflicted with loyalty to a promise? And in a world that often rewards the loudest voice, what value do we place on those who ask "How did the team do, dear?"
