> "If you can say something beautiful in a very terrible way — I was always drawn to that."

<p class="firstLetter">There's something almost otherworldly about Andrew Hozier-Byrne. In an era of carefully curated social media personas and calculated image management, the Irish singer-songwriter stands apart — a self-described "gangly introvert" who transforms human suffering into transcendent art.</p>

What drives a man to spend an entire year crafting a single song? What compels him to draw inspiration from 14th-century Italian poetry while writing about modern love and loss? And why does his music move people to tears in a way that few contemporary artists can match?

The answer lies deep within Hozier's psychological architecture — a mind that processes the world through the lens of profound emotional depth and an unquenchable thirst for authenticity.

<div class="panel">
<ul>
<li><b>Deep Emotional Processing:</b> Hozier spends up to a year writing a single song, sitting with emotions until they're perfectly expressed — classic Type 4 dedication to authentic self-expression.</li>

## What is Hozier's Personality Type?

### Hozier is an Enneagram Type 4 (The Individualist)

[Enneagram Type 4s](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-4) are known as "The Individualist" or "The Romantic." They are driven by a need to understand themselves and find their unique identity. Type 4s often feel fundamentally different from others and seek to express this uniqueness through creative endeavors.

What makes Hozier such a compelling example of this type is how completely he embodies both its gifts and its struggles. His music isn't just entertainment — it's an excavation of the human soul, filtered through his distinctive emotional lens.

**The Core Fear:** Type 4s fear having no identity or personal significance. Watch Hozier recoil from celebrity culture — "Truth be told, I'm not all that comfortable with celebrity culture. That was always something that baffled me, the obsession over fame." This isn't false modesty. It's a Type 4's genuine confusion about why anyone would pursue external validation when the real work is internal.

**The Core Desire:** Type 4s want to find themselves and their significance, to create an identity from their inner experience. Hozier's entire artistic mission reflects this: "When I write songs, I try to remove myself a little bit. Obviously they're very personal to me, but it feels easier if I feel like I'm writing characters."

This creative distance — processing deeply personal material through artistic characters — is quintessential Type 4 behavior.

## Hozier's Upbringing: A Foundation of Depth

Andrew John Hozier-Byrne was born on March 17, 1990, near Bray in County Wicklow, Ireland. His childhood was shaped by two powerful forces: music and hardship.

His father John was a local banker by day but a jazz and blues drummer by night, filling young Andrew's world with the sounds of John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and Tom Waits. His mother Raine was a visual artist — she would later design his album covers. Both parents had been raised Catholic but converted to Quakerism, raising Andrew in that faith tradition.

Then, when Andrew was six, his father underwent spinal surgery. The complications left him wheelchair-bound, and for years afterward, the family struggled financially while his father was unemployed.

"It changed all of our lives," Hozier later reflected. "It changed his life, it kind of ruined his life in a big way."

This early exposure to suffering, combined with his artistic household and the introspective Quaker tradition, created the perfect conditions for a Type 4 personality to develop. Young Andrew learned early that life contained both profound beauty and devastating pain — and that art could somehow hold both.

Growing up in the Irish countryside near the village of Delgany, surrounded by nature and his parents' record collection, he began teaching himself guitar at 15 and writing songs soon after.

## Rise to Fame: The Reluctant Star

Hozier's path to stardom was anything but calculated. After singing in his school choir and joining the Irish choral ensemble Anúna (from 2007-2012), he enrolled at Trinity College Dublin to study music education.

He would never finish. After missing exams to record demos for a music label and being refused a year's deferral, he chose music over academia.

In 2013, he released "Take Me to Church" independently, recording it in a makeshift attic studio in his parents' home. The song drew on his frustrations with the Catholic Church's treatment of LGBTQ+ people, wrapped in the language of religious ecstasy.

"Growing up in Ireland, the church is ever present, and a lot of the feeling in the song stems from frustration with its hypocrisy and political cowardice," he explained.

The music video, depicting violence against a same-sex couple in Russia, went viral. Suddenly, the introverted Irish songwriter found himself thrust into global fame.

"I'm still trying to get my head around it all," he admitted at the time. "It's been a very steep learning curve... I didn't expect this, and I haven't really processed it yet."

This discomfort with sudden success is deeply Type 4. While Type 3s might strategize their rise and Type 7s might embrace the adventure, Type 4s often feel almost suspicious of external validation. Their identity comes from within — what does mass popularity really mean?

## Personality Quirks, Habits, and the Type 4 Mind

### The Year-Long Song

Perhaps nothing reveals Hozier's Type 4 nature more clearly than his songwriting process.

"It could take me a year to write a song. It could take a year and a half," he revealed. He describes it as "some sort of process of elimination, sort of trimming off the shoots that ultimately might fail and kill the whole plant."

His former girlfriend Loah described watching him "go up to their attic room and spend nine hours on the same thing every day."

This isn't perfectionism in the Type 1 sense — it's the Type 4's need to get the emotion exactly right, to capture the precise shade of feeling they're trying to express.

### The Observer Who Watched

"I spent a lot of time watching people growing up, trying to decipher the person behind the person."

This quote reveals the 5 wing influence on Hozier's Type 4 core. The 4w5 (sometimes called "The Bohemian") combines the emotional depth of the 4 with the intellectual curiosity of the 5. They don't just feel — they analyze their feelings. They don't just create — they study the nature of creation itself.

This explains Hozier's attraction to literature and poetry. When the pandemic hit, he didn't just sit with his feelings — he dove into Dante's *Inferno*, eventually structuring his entire third album around the 14th-century poem.

### The Introvert Who Performs

"By nature I'm an awkward person, I'm a gangly introvert."

Hozier's stage presence creates what observers call "an unintentional juxtaposition" — this shy, contemplative man delivering powerful performances to screaming crowds.

He's open about his discomfort: "I'm not quite used to being seen through the eyes of fans yet. Being met with squeals and screams — I haven't gotten used to that. I hate nightclubs, and I get fed up very quickly in crowded rooms."

When touring, he misses simple pleasures — making breakfast, access to Irish cream and honey from his bees, the solitude of his own kitchen. He returns to his hometown whenever possible to reconnect with childhood friends and find himself again.

### Love as Death and Rebirth

Hozier's views on love reveal the romantic intensity typical of Type 4s:

"I found the experience of falling in love or being in love was a death: a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment — if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes — everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense."

This isn't hyperbole for Hozier — it's lived experience. Type 4s often experience emotions at a depth that others find overwhelming. Where some might describe falling in love as "exciting" or "wonderful," a Type 4 processes it as ego death and spiritual transformation.

## Major Accomplishments

Hozier's career achievements are remarkable, especially for someone so averse to the machinery of fame:

- **"Take Me to Church"** reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been certified Diamond in the US — one of the highest certifications possible
- **"Too Sweet"** (2024) became his first #1 single in Ireland, the US, and the UK, making him the first Irish artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 since 1990
- **Three studio albums:** *Hozier* (2014), *Wasteland, Baby!* (2019), and *Unreal Unearth* (2023)
- **Grammy nomination** for Song of the Year (2015)
- **TIME 100 Most Influential People** (2025) — fellow musician Noah Kahan wrote: "When an artist can create a sound so beautiful and melancholy, so full of symbolism and truth that you feel they must be from a different time, or a better world, you can't help but believe in magic."
- **Billboard Music Awards:** Top Rock Artist and Top Rock Songs (2015)
- **Ivor Novello Award** for Song of the Year
- **HMMA Award** for Best Original Song in a Video Game for "Blood Upon the Snow" (God of War: Ragnarök)

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Israel-Palestine Stance

At a 2024 concert in New York, Hozier expressed solidarity with Palestinians affected by the conflict in Gaza. While most of the crowd cheered, some attendees walked out, with one yelling "f--k you Hozier" before leaving.

Hozier has consistently taken political stances in his music and public appearances, stating: "I am a politically motivated person, and that will come through in the music."

### The Girlfriend Drama

When fans discovered his relationship with model Hana Mayeda in 2024, some began harassing her on social media. Old photos showing her participating in a "smudging" ceremony (burning desert sage, an Indigenous practice) resurfaced, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation.

Later, viral screenshots allegedly showed her liking problematic posts on social media. Mayeda issued a statement calling the screenshots "fabricated" and affirming her support for "trans rights, and justice, freedom and liberation for the Palestinian people."

Hozier himself posted asking fans to leave his girlfriend alone, calling the speculation "baseless, insensitive, and disrespectful."

### The "Take Me to Church" Religious Backlash

The song's critique of organized religion drew criticism from religious communities. MTV and VH1 initially refused to play the music video.

Hozier has maintained his position: "I'm not religious myself, but my issue is with the organization. It's an organization of men — it's not about faith."

## Hozier's Legacy and Current Work

### The Unreal Unearth Era

Hozier's third album, *Unreal Unearth* (2023), represents his most ambitious artistic statement. Structured around Dante's *Inferno*, each song corresponds to a circle of Hell, transforming pandemic isolation into mythological journey.

"I didn't want to write songs that were about a lockdown," he explained. "I didn't want to write songs that were about the pandemic."

Instead, he found in Dante's 700-year-old poem a framework for exploring universal human experiences of loss, longing, and transformation.

The album includes his first songs sung in the Irish language — another act of reclamation and identity assertion that speaks to his Type 4 nature.

### Activism and Values

Throughout his career, Hozier has used his platform for causes he believes in:

- **LGBTQ+ Rights:** The "Take Me to Church" video highlighted violence against gay men in Russia
- **Domestic Violence Awareness:** The "Cherry Wine" video, which featured Irish actress [Saoirse Ronan](/personality-analysis/Saoirse-Ronan), raised awareness of intimate partner abuse
- **Reproductive Rights:** "Swan Upon Leda" (2022) responded to the overturning of Roe v. Wade
- **Protest Music Tradition:** "Nina Cried Power" featured names of artists like Nina Simone and [Bob Dylan](/personality-analysis/Bob-Dylan) who used their art for social change

"You grow up and recognise that in an educated, secular society, there's no excuse for ignorance," he says. "You have to recognise in yourself, and challenge yourself, that if you see racism or homophobia or misogyny in a secular society, as a member of that society, you should challenge it."

### The Ongoing Tour

The *Unreal Unearth* tour has stretched across 2023-2025, with over 83 performances across 72 cities in North America alone. A deluxe version of the album, *Unreal Unearth: Unending*, was released in December 2024, including the new song "Hymn to Virgil."

## The Type 4's Gift to the World

What makes Hozier matter isn't just his considerable musical talent — it's his willingness to go deep into emotional territory that others avoid.

Type 4s serve as emotional pioneers for the rest of us. They explore the depths of human experience and return with songs, poems, and paintings that help us understand our own inner lives. Like fellow Type 4 [Billie Eilish](/personality-analysis/Billie-Eilish), Hozier channels his introspective nature into music that resonates with those seeking authenticity in an increasingly superficial world.

"It's whatever catches you at the moment," Hozier says of his inspiration. "Maybe verbalizing a feeling to yourself in your head that you usually wouldn't, or what you're doing or looking at in that moment. Turning the everyday into words. Or a thought or feeling you're almost shocked to admit to yourself."

In a world that often encourages us to suppress difficult emotions, Hozier reminds us that there's beauty in the darkness — that melancholy can be as valuable as joy, and that authentic self-expression matters more than fitting in.

What might we discover if we, like Hozier, were willing to sit with a single feeling until we understood it completely? What songs are waiting to be written in the attic rooms of our own souls?
