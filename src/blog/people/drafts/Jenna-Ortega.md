<p class="firstLetter">You know her as Wednesday Addams.</p>

Or maybe as Tara Carpenter from _Scream_. But behind those characters is Jenna Ortega, a young actress whose meteoric rise hasn't come without cost.

At just 22, she's already navigated the entertainment industry for over a decade. Her face is everywhere. Her talent, undeniable. Her box office total now exceeds **$700 million**.

But who is she, really?

To understand Jenna more deeply, we need to look at her through the lens of the Enneagram, specifically, [Type 3: The Achiever](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-3). Type 3s are driven, adaptable, and image-conscious. They measure their worth through accomplishments and recognition.

Sound familiar?

Yet Jenna isn't your textbook Type 3. She's a fascinating contradiction, a celebrity who calls the concept of celebrities "absolutely ridiculous," a performer who craves privacy, an achiever who questions the very nature of achievement.

Let's dive into the real Jenna Ortega.

## The Seeds of Achievement: Jenna's Early Drive

At just six years old, Jenna Ortega already knew what she wanted.

To act.

Her mother wasn't convinced. But little Jenna, fourth of six siblings in a busy Mexican and Puerto Rican household in Coachella Valley, wouldn't take no for an answer.

For _three years_ she begged. Pleaded. Persisted.

This is classic Type 3 behavior emerging early. That unwavering determination, that need to pursue something that will bring recognition. But Jenna's mother tried to redirect her energy elsewhere. Soccer. School. Anything but the uncertain world of child acting.

"I wanted to act from the age of six and begged my mother to let me pursue a career for three years," Jenna has shared.

There's a deeper layer here too. Jenna has revealed that she was "very existential" as a child—"The world was always ending. I was worrying about things way earlier than I needed to." Acting, she later admitted, "served as an escape from the pressure she placed on herself."

This is fascinating Type 3 psychology: achievement as escape. Even at a young age, Jenna's drive wasn't just about wanting spotlight. It was about channeling intense internal anxiety into something productive, something that could bring external validation to quiet the inner critic.

Her mother finally relented when Jenna was nine, posting a video of her performing a monologue online. A casting director saw it and signed her to an agency.

The rest is history.

But history came with sacrifice. Her mother began driving her to Los Angeles as often as five days per week for auditions, a six-hour round trip from Coachella Valley. Jenna struggled initially because "few parts existed for Latinas" and she "didn't look [a certain] way."

This early experience of not fitting the mold likely intensified her Type 3 drive: the need to prove she belonged, to work harder than everyone else, to make herself undeniable.

## The Achiever's Evolving Image: From Disney to Darkness

One trait that sets Type 3s apart? _Adaptability_.

Jenna's career showcases this beautifully. She seamlessly transitioned from Disney Channel's wholesome "Stuck in the Middle" to Netflix's macabre "Wednesday." From family-friendly "Yes Day" to slasher films like "X" and "Scream."

Most actors get typecast. Jenna shape-shifts.

This chameleonic ability is pure Type 3 energy. Threes often unconsciously adapt their identities to succeed in different environments. They read the room and become what it needs.

When Ti West was casting for the horror film "X," he noted Jenna was "fearless in her commitment." She took on the role because she found the script "the most outrageous thing I've ever read."

For a Type 3, this adaptability is both strength and struggle.

_Am I adapting because I genuinely connect with these diverse roles? Or am I just proving my versatility?_

This might be the question lurking in Jenna's mind during career transitions. Because for Threes, the line between authentic growth and achievement-chasing can blur.

Her evolution from Disney darling to 2022's "scream queen" wasn't just a career strategy. It was her Type 3 superpower of reinvention at work. (Her fellow young horror star [Sydney Sweeney](/personality-analysis/Sydney-Sweeney) has made a similar genre transition, though with different personality drivers.)

And the numbers prove it worked. **Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** alone grossed $451 million worldwide, pushing Jenna's career box office total past $700 million at just 22 years old. Publications credited her specifically for attracting younger audiences, Generation Z flocking to see a Tim Burton sequel because of her.

The original cast noticed too. Michael Keaton and Catherine O'Hara credited Jenna for helping director Tim Burton finally realize his long-awaited sequel, noting the actress "literally didn't exist" when the 1988 original premiered.

For a Type 3, being credited as the catalyst for a $451 million success? That's the external validation that feeds the achievement drive.

## Behind the Mask: Jenna's Internal Landscape

What goes on behind Jenna's composed exterior?

Type 3s are fascinating because they're part of the "heart triad" in Enneagram theory, emotion-driven types, yet they often disconnect from their feelings to achieve.

Jenna has described wanting to be a "private person," stating that she doesn't discuss her romantic life publicly because it distracts from her work.

This is revealing.

For Type 3s, emotions can feel like distractions from achievement. They compartmentalize feelings that might slow them down.

"My family gives me a sense of safety that helps me deal with the more challenging parts of my career," Jenna has shared, adding they "keep her feet on the ground."

**Family becomes the safe space where the mask can come off.**

This is crucial for Threes, who often struggle with the question: _Who am I when I'm not achieving?_

### The Achiever's Crisis: Success Without Happiness

Perhaps the most revealing moment in understanding Jenna's Type 3 psychology came in a 2025 interview where she admitted something startling:

"To be quite frank, after the show and trying to figure everything out, I was an unhappy person. After the pressure, the attention, as somebody who's quite introverted, that was so intense and so scary."

This is the Type 3's core existential crisis laid bare.

Wednesday was a massive success. Emmy nominations. Golden Globe nominations. Global fame. Every metric of achievement was off the charts.

And she was miserable.

This is what happens when a Three achieves everything they thought they wanted and discovers it doesn't fill the void. The external validation they've been chasing since childhood doesn't automatically create internal peace.

Jenna describing herself as "quite introverted" is also significant. Many people assume Type 3s are natural extroverts because of their charm and public success. But Jenna reveals a different picture, someone who performs extroversion professionally while actually needing solitude to recharge.

The pressure was so intense that she developed physical symptoms. She's mentioned struggling with anxiety severe enough that she chewed through her Invisalign from grinding her teeth at night.

_This is what it costs to be the machine._

Few moments reveal this struggle more than her comments about Wednesday Addams, a character defined by her refusal to conform or seek approval.

Is playing a non-people-pleaser therapeutic for someone whose personality type tends toward image-consciousness?

_Probably._

## Wednesday's Challenge: Finding Her Voice

When Jenna stepped into Wednesday Addams' platform shoes, something clicked.

The role earned her Golden Globe, Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. For a Type 3, that external validation matters, _a lot_.

But there's something deeper in her connection to Wednesday.

Wednesday Addams doesn't care what people think. She's brutally authentic. The polar opposite of a people-pleasing Three.

Yet playing her required Jenna to tap into something real within herself. As she worked on the character, she had to find those parts of herself that resonated with Wednesday's darkness and intensity.

"I would have to do things I've never done before," she's mentioned about the role's physical and emotional demands.

For Type 3s, who often struggle with authenticity, playing someone authentically different can be strangely liberating.

It creates a safe distance to explore aspects of yourself you normally suppress.

### The Writers Controversy: A Type 3 Learning Moment

But Wednesday also brought controversy.

In 2023, Jenna revealed on a podcast that she had changed dialogue on set without consulting the show's writers, claiming the scripts "made no sense" from a character perspective. Writers took to social media calling her "toxic" and "beyond entitled." The backlash was swift and harsh.

For a Type 3, whose identity is partially built on how they're perceived, public criticism cuts deep.

In 2024, she reflected: "I probably could have used my words better in describing all of that."

By 2025, she was more direct: "I used my words really poorly. All I had to do was say 'improvised.' You live and you learn."

This evolution shows a Type 3 developing self-awareness about image management. Not just how to project success, but how to handle missteps authentically.

### From Star to Producer: The Type 3 Evolution

The resolution to the writers controversy is telling.

For Wednesday Season 2, Jenna didn't just return as star, she became an **Executive Producer**.

This is a massive shift. Rather than changing lines covertly, she now has official creative input. Rather than being perceived as overstepping, she has legitimate authority.

She described it as a "natural progression" due to the first season's collaborative nature.

This move is classic Type 3 growth: transforming a weakness (perceived entitlement) into a strength (official creative partnership). Instead of fighting the system, she leveled up within it.

Netflix's investment in her is significant too, Season 3 was renewed in July 2025 before Season 2 even premiered. They're betting big on Jenna Ortega, the producer and creative force, not just Jenna Ortega the actress.

## Beyond the Spotlight: Jenna's Values and Vision

Not all Type 3s are the same. What makes Jenna's expression of this type unique is where she directs her achievement energy.

Many Threes chase conventional success markers, money, status, recognition.

Jenna seems drawn to something different.

She uses her platform for advocacy work, speaking out on mental health awareness, immigration issues, and representation in Hollywood. Her Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage matters to her. She embraces being Latina in an industry that hasn't always made space for diversity.

"I routinely partner with charitable organizations," Jenna has noted, mentioning work with the National Bullying Prevention Center and other causes.

She's also spoken candidly about representation: "I feel like the Latinx community, first of all, they're not often shown on camera in general. But they're also oftentimes not shown in a positive light. I never want to play a maid and I never want to play a cartel leader's daughter. I would much rather play a person of power."

This reveals a Three in the process of _integration_, moving beyond pure achievement toward meaningful contribution.

For Threes, this evolution is huge. It's the shift from "What can I accomplish?" to "What can I contribute?"

### Directing Ambitions: Behind the Camera

Perhaps the most fascinating glimpse of Jenna's evolution is her desire to move behind the camera entirely.

In 2025, she revealed she's been writing a script for "almost 10 years" and feels now is the right time to bring it to life. She wants to direct.

But here's the key insight:

"I don't want to be in the things that I create in the future, but starting out, because I've created more leverage for myself with a name as an actor, I may as well use that as a stepping stone."

This is sophisticated Type 3 self-awareness. She recognizes her fame as a tool, leverage, but doesn't want to be defined by it. She's using achievement to move _beyond_ achievement-based identity.

For a type that's typically obsessed with being seen, wanting to work "entirely behind the scenes" is remarkable growth. It suggests Jenna is moving toward what Enneagram teachers call "integration", accessing the positive qualities of [Type 6](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-6) (collaboration, loyalty, depth) rather than staying stuck in image-management.

## The Achiever's Toolkit: Coping and Strengths

How does Jenna handle the pressure that comes with being both a Type 3 and a rising star?

First, **immersion in work**. Threes often cope with stress by doubling down on achievement. For Jenna, this means taking on challenging roles that demand total focus.

Her 2025 alone included:

- **Death of a Unicorn** (A24 horror-comedy with Paul Rudd)
- **Hurry Up Tomorrow** (The Weeknd's film)
- **Wednesday Season 2** as both star and executive producer

Upcoming, she has The Gallerist with <a href="/personality-analysis/Natalie-Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, Ghostwriter with J.J. Abrams, Klara and the Sun with Taika Waititi, a Single White Female remake, and a David O. Russell project with Robert De Niro.

That's not a schedule. That's a statement of purpose.

Second, **compartmentalization**. She creates clear boundaries between her public and private selves. When she says she wants to keep her romantic life private, that's not just a preference. It's a survival strategy for a Three whose identity is so tied to her professional image.

Third, **family grounding**. She consistently mentions her family as her anchor. For Threes who can get lost in external validation, having people who love you regardless of achievement is essential.

What causes stress for Jenna? Likely the things that threaten a Three's core needs:

- Feeling incompetent or unprepared
- Criticism of her performance (the writers controversy hit hard)
- Situations where her image isn't within her control
- The pressure to maintain success

And what brings her joy?

- Mastering new skills (like the cello for "Wednesday")
- Recognition from peers she respects
- Successfully shapeshifting into challenging characters
- Using her platform for meaningful causes

These patterns reveal Type 3s find genuine fulfillment when their achievements align with authentic values, when doing well and doing good coincide.

### The "White Man Confidence" Philosophy

One quote captures Jenna's evolved approach to the pressures she faces.

Her cello teacher on Wednesday gave her life-changing advice: as long as she looked confident in her movements and fully embodied the character, it would work. "She told me that I just needed to approach everything I do in life with the confidence of the average white man. That changed my life."

This is classic Type 3 wisdom, but with a twist. Rather than performing confidence to impress others, Jenna learned to use it as internal armor. It's about believing you belong, even when the world sends signals that you don't.

For a Latina actress who struggled early in her career because she "didn't look [a certain] way," this reframe is powerful. It transforms the Type 3's natural chameleon ability from people-pleasing into self-assertion.

## Controversies and Growth

Jenna hasn't avoided controversy entirely.

Beyond the writers situation, she sparked backlash in 2024 for comments on political correctness. "The business that we work in is so touchy-feely. Everybody wants to be politically correct, but I feel like, in doing that, we lose a lot of our humanity and integrity, because it lacks honesty."

This comment came during a charged cultural moment, and reactions were mixed.

There was also **Miller's Girl** (2024), an erotic thriller pairing her with Martin Freeman that drew criticism for depicting a controversial teacher-student dynamic. The film received poor reviews (30% on Rotten Tomatoes) but demonstrated Jenna's willingness to take risks, even ones that don't pay off.

And then the dating rumors, particularly the bizarre gossip linking her to <a href="/personality-analysis/Johnny-Depp">Johnny Depp</a>, nearly 40 years her senior. She called the rumor "insane" and moved on.

How does a Type 3 handle controversy?

By learning, adapting, and redirecting energy toward the next achievement. The writers controversy led to producer credits. The political correctness backlash didn't stop her momentum. The Miller's Girl criticism faded as bigger successes arrived.

For Threes, setbacks are data points, not destinations.

## Conclusion: The Real Achievement – Becoming Herself

Jenna Ortega at 22 is still evolving.

Her journey as a Type 3 is just beginning. The most interesting chapters likely lie ahead.

Will she continue to find roles that challenge her? Almost certainly, her slate through 2026 includes some of cinema's most exciting directors.

Will she use her platform for causes she believes in? The evidence suggests yes.

Will she actually direct that script she's been writing for ten years? That would be the ultimate test of her evolution beyond pure performance.

But the deeper question: the one that matters most for any Three, is whether she'll increasingly measure her worth by _who she is_ rather than _what she accomplishes_.

Her admission of being "an unhappy person" after Wednesday's success suggests she's already grappling with this. That awareness itself is growth.

The irony for Threes like Jenna is profound: **their greatest achievement often isn't visible on a resume or IMDB page**. It's the internal shift from external validation to self-acceptance.

Fans connect with Jenna not just because of her undeniable talent, but because they sense this struggle underneath. The desire to be seen. The fear of being seen too much. The quest for authentic expression in a world that rewards performance.

In some ways, her journey mirrors our own. Aren't we all trying to balance achievement with authenticity? Success with soul?

Watching Jenna navigate these waters in the harsh spotlight of fame offers a masterclass in the Type 3 challenge: to transform from _The Achiever_ into something more complex and complete—

A person who achieves, yes. But also one who simply, fully _is_.

And that's the real Wednesday challenge. Not just playing a character who knows exactly who she is.

But becoming someone who does.
