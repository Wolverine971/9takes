## REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Add Citations

Many blogs make claims without inline citations. Consider adding source links for:

- Historical dates and events
- Specific statistics
- Direct quotes from individuals

### Priority 2: Content Expansion

Some blogs are brief (RBG, George H.W. Bush, Jackie Kennedy). Consider expanding with more detailed personality analysis.
