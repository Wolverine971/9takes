<p class="firstLetter">"I've always been blubbery," Winston Churchill once admitted. "You have to get used to it."</p>

Not what you expect from the British Bulldog. The man who stared down Hitler. The embodiment of the stiff upper lip.

Yet Churchill wept openly at funerals, during films, upon visiting bombed neighborhoods. He battled what he called his "Black Dog" of depression for decades. He picked up painting at 40 to keep from going mad with grief. And he kept a photograph of his childhood nanny by his bedside until the day he died.

The real Churchill was far more interesting than the bronze statue version. The Enneagram helps us see how all these contradictions fit together inside one extraordinary Type 8 mind.

## What Made Churchill a Type 8?

Enneagram 8s share a core drive: never be controlled. Never be vulnerable. Never be at the mercy of others.

They build themselves into forces of nature. Commanding. Decisive. Seemingly invincible.

But here's what most people miss about 8s: underneath all that armor lives a wounded child who learned early that the world wasn't safe. 8s don't become tough because they're naturally callous. They become tough because they had to.

Churchill fits this pattern precisely. His entire life oscillated between projecting unstoppable strength and fighting the darkness within.

## The Boy Nobody Wanted

To understand Churchill, start with the lonely boy at Blenheim Palace.

His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a brilliant but unstable politician who had little use for his son. His mother Jennie, a glamorous American socialite, was consumed by her own social calendar. Young Winston once wrote to her begging for attention: "**I have only one who loves me, and that is you.**"

The letters often went unanswered.

But one person loved him unconditionally: Elizabeth Everest, his nanny. He called her "Woom" (the closest he could get to "Woman" as a toddler), and she became his entire world.

As Churchill wrote in his autobiography: "**My nurse was my confidante. Mrs Everest it was who looked after me and tended all my wants. It was to her I poured out all my many troubles.**"

Violet Asquith captured Mrs. Everest's role perfectly: "She was his comforter, his strength and stay, his one source of unfailing human understanding. She was the fireside at which he dried his tears and warmed his heart. She was the night-light by his bed. She was security."

When Mrs. Everest died in 1895, Churchill was the only family member at her bedside. He paid for her tombstone, arranged for flowers on her grave for years, and kept her photograph displayed until his death seventy years later.

This early experience shaped the 8 pattern that would define his life. Parents who rejected him. A nanny who saved him. The result: fierce independence, deep distrust of vulnerability, and bone-deep loyalty to those who proved themselves worthy.

## The Black Dog: Churchill's Lifelong Battle

Churchill famously called his depression his "Black Dog." The phrase came from Victorian nannies describing bad moods, but Churchill applied it to something far more serious.

In 1911, he wrote to Clementine: "**I think this man might be useful to me, if my Black Dog returns. He seems quite away from me now. It is such a relief. All the colours came back into the picture.**"

The colors going out of the picture. That's depression.

His doctor, Lord Moran, observed "prolonged fits of depression" throughout Churchill's life and later diagnosed him with what we'd now call bipolar tendencies. For decades, Churchill avoided standing too close to train platforms and ship railings.

As he confessed: "**I don't like standing near the edge of a platform when an express train is passing through... A second's action would end everything.**"

How did a man battling suicidal thoughts become the leader who saved Western civilization?

This is where the 8's psychology becomes crucial. 8s don't just fight external enemies. They fight internal ones with the same ferocity.

Churchill weaponized his drive against his darkness. He stayed relentlessly busy. He wrote, painted, built brick walls at his estate, gave speeches, drank champagne, and kept moving. Always moving.

His daughter Lady Soames observed: "Marriage to my mother, and later his discovery of painting, which was a lifelong solace, largely kennelled the Black Dog."

The 8's response to pain isn't to sit with it. It's to overpower it through sheer force of will.

## Painting: How Churchill Saved Himself

In 1915, Churchill's world collapsed.

As First Lord of the Admiralty, he'd championed the Gallipoli campaign, a disastrous invasion that killed over 100,000 Allied troops. He was publicly blamed, stripped of his position, and demoted to a meaningless role.

His wife Clementine later said she thought he would die of grief.

Then, watching his sister-in-law paint watercolors during a family retreat, he picked up a brush. Something clicked.

"**Painting came to my rescue in a most trying time,**" he later wrote.

Over the next five decades, Churchill painted more than 500 canvases. Landscapes, still lifes, scenes from Marrakesh to the French Riviera.

"**If it weren't for painting, I couldn't live. I couldn't bear the strain of things.**"

This is textbook 8 behavior under stress. When 8s are overwhelmed, they move toward Type 5. They retreat. They become quiet, secretive, contemplative. Nothing like their usual charging-forward selves.

Churchill found in painting a way to process emotions he couldn't express directly. A way to create beauty when his world was falling apart.

The hobby was so influential that President Eisenhower, inspired by Churchill, set up a painting studio in the White House. He remains the only U.S. president to do so.

## The Wilderness Years: Right While Everyone Ignored Him

If you want to see 8 resilience at its purest, look at Churchill in the 1930s.

By 1930, he was a political pariah. He'd opposed Indian independence (wrong side of history), supported Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis (political suicide), and spent his days at his beloved Chartwell estate writing books and newspaper articles.

Most people thought his career was over.

But Churchill saw something others didn't. Or didn't want to see. Hitler's rise. Germany's rearmament. The coming storm.

As early as 1933, Churchill warned Parliament of "odious conditions in Germany" and the threat of "another persecution and pogrom of Jews." In 1934, he declared "**there is not an hour to lose**" in building up British defenses.

The establishment fought him. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald tried to silence him. The Conservative Party kept him off the BBC. He was dismissed as a warmonger, a scaremonger, a relic.

Churchill kept warning anyway.

This is pure 8 energy. The willingness to stand alone against the crowd. To trust your own judgment when everyone says you're wrong. To endure mockery and isolation rather than back down.

When war came in 1939 and his predictions proved horrifically accurate, Churchill was brought back as First Lord of the Admiralty.

As he wrote in his memoirs: "**My warnings over the last six years had been so numerous, so detailed, and were now so terribly vindicated, that no one could gainsay me.**"

## Clementine: The Woman Who Could Challenge an 8

8s are notoriously difficult partners. They dominate conversations, make unilateral decisions, and hate being challenged.

So how did Winston Churchill stay married for 57 years?

Clementine Hozier was not a pushover. She was one of the few people who could tell Churchill when he was wrong and make him listen.

Their marriage worked partly because they gave each other space. She was an early riser; he worked until 3 AM. She loved outdoor sports; he loved books and painting. They slept in separate bedrooms.

Rather than forcing conformity, they let each other be themselves.

But Clementine also served as Churchill's moral compass. When he was being cruel to his staff (a common 8 failing), she'd write him letters calling him out: "Your manner is not good." During the war, when he considered morally questionable tactics, she pushed back.

Their love letters, compiled by their daughter Mary into a 700-page book, reveal a tenderness Churchill rarely showed the world. They drew little cartoons for each other. She drew cats; he drew pigs. They signed off with pet names and declarations of love.

For an 8, finding someone who can stand up to you without triggering your defenses is rare. Clementine did this for Churchill for over half a century. When he died, she was at his bedside.

## The Darker Side: Bengal and the 8's Blind Spots

No honest analysis of Churchill can ignore his failures. And they were significant.

The 1943 Bengal Famine killed between 2 and 3 million people. Churchill's wartime government diverted food supplies away from India, and his comments about the famine were callous at best. According to Secretary of State for India Leo Amery's diaries, Churchill said in private that he "hated Indians" and considered them "a beastly people with a beastly religion."

When informed of the starvation, he reportedly said Indians "must learn to look after themselves as we have done."

Historians debate how much blame Churchill personally deserves. The causes of the famine were complex, and his government did eventually send aid. But his racist attitudes toward Indians are well-documented, and his initial response to their suffering was dismissive.

This reveals the shadow side of the 8 personality. The belief that you know best. The dismissal of those you consider weak. The inability to recognize your own blind spots.

Churchill could weep for bombed-out British families and remain cold to suffering elsewhere in the Empire.

8s at their worst become tyrants, convinced of their own righteousness, brutal to those who get in their way. Churchill had both the heroic and tyrannical aspects of the 8 in full measure.

## The 1945 Shock: When the Nation Said No

Three months after Germany surrendered, Britain held an election. Churchill was the most popular man in the country, with approval ratings above 80%.

He lost in a landslide.

The Labour Party won 393 seats to the Conservatives' 197. A humiliating rejection.

Churchill woke on July 26, 1945, with what he described as "a sharp stab of almost physical pain. A hitherto subconscious conviction that we were beaten broke forth and dominated my mind... **The power to shape the future would be denied me.**"

Clementine, trying to comfort him, suggested the defeat might be "a blessing in disguise."

Churchill's reply was quintessential 8: "**At the moment it seems quite effectively disguised.**"

King George VI offered him the Order of the Garter, the highest honor in his gift. Churchill declined, noting ruefully that the British people had just given him "**the order of the boot.**"

How does an 8 handle public rejection after their greatest triumph? With gallows humor, wounded pride, and eventually a comeback.

Churchill remained party leader, kept fighting, and won the 1951 election to serve as Prime Minister again until 1955.

8s don't stay down. Even when they're crushed, they get back up.

## The Type 8's Growth Path: From Challenger to Helper

Understanding Churchill fully requires understanding how 8s grow and struggle according to the Enneagram.

**Under stress, 8s move toward Type 5.** They become withdrawn, secretive, detached. They retreat from the front lines to observe and strategize.

Churchill showed this pattern clearly. His painting. His prolific writing (over 40 books, winning him the Nobel Prize in Literature). His periods of depression and isolation. When overwhelmed, he didn't keep charging forward. He withdrew into contemplation.

**In growth, 8s move toward Type 2.** They become more nurturing, more attuned to others' needs, more willing to be vulnerable.

Churchill showed this too. His devotion to Clementine. His fierce loyalty to friends. His capacity for tears and empathy. Clement Attlee, his political rival, noted Churchill's "extreme sensitiveness to suffering" and recalled "his eyes filling up with tears when he talked of the sufferings of the Jews in Germany."

The man who could be brutal and domineering could also be tender and caring. That's the 8's paradox.

## A Man of Contradictions

Winston Churchill was:

- A warrior who wept openly at films
- A commanding presence who battled crippling depression
- A man who projected invincibility while confessing to suicidal thoughts
- A leader who inspired millions while treating some of his staff terribly
- A defender of freedom who held racist views about colonized peoples
- A husband who adored his wife but slept in a separate bedroom

All of this makes sense through the lens of the Type 8. The armor. The vulnerability underneath. The drive to control because control feels like survival. The fierce loyalty and fierce cruelty. The refusal to ever surrender.

"**History will be kind to me,**" Churchill once said, "**for I intend to write it.**"

And he did. Both with his pen and with his actions.

For all his flaws, when civilization needed someone willing to stand alone against evil, Churchill was there. The Black Dog howling at his heels. Paint still drying on his canvas. The photo of Mrs. Everest by his bed.

That's what a Type 8 can become. Not a hero without shadows. Someone whose fierce will makes them equal to the moment, even when that moment is the darkest in history.
