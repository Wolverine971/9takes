<!-- Notes: Gigi is most likely not a 1,3 or an 8. She is pretty meek and mild-- almost shy. Her mother pushed her to be a model and have a specific body type. There was also the fight between Zayn and her mom-- where she took her mother's side. I could see her as a 6-- although this is just based off the little I know. -->

<p class="firstLetter">You've glimpsed her on the runways, admired her in fashion magazines, and followed her dynamic life through the lens of social media. Gigi Hadid, the internationally acclaimed model, is more than just a face in the crowd. Today, we dig beneath the surface to interpret Hadid's persona through the intriguing perspective of the Enneagram Type 4, the Individualist.</p>

## Gigi Hadid's Intrinsic Individualism: A Peek into the Life of a Type 4

Enneagram Type 4 individuals, like Gigi, are known for their introspective nature and a constant quest for uniqueness. Looking at Hadid's career path, her bold fashion choices that set trends rather than following them, and her originality in representing herself in the public eye, all point towards this individualistic trait.

Gigi's move to separate herself from the stereotypical model image has always been evident. From embracing her natural body type in a world pressuring conformity to the waif-thin model norm, to her openly voicing her perspectives on social and political issues - Gigi exemplifies the essence of a Type 4.

The highly publicized feud with designer Tommy Hilfiger ü•ä, who allegedly wanted her to wear a poncho on the runway due to her not fitting the 'typical' model body type, stands out. Instead of succumbing, Gigi turned this into an opportunity for personal expression and authenticity, hallmarks of a Type 4 personality.

## Drama, Controversy, and The Enneagram Type 4

One incident that stands out as a testament to Gigi's Type 4 personality was when she defended herself against a prankster during Milan Fashion Week in 2016. Her assertion, instead of relying on her bodyguards, was not only a bold statement of self-expression, but also a deep sense of identity, which is a core characteristic of Type 4 individuals.

Type 4's often feel misunderstood, a sentiment Gigi has shared when discussing her struggles with Hashimoto's disease. She's used her platform to raise awareness, expressing her longing to be seen for who she truly is, which parallels the Type 4's desire for understanding and authenticity.
