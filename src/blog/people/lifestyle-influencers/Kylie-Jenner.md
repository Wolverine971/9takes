## The Unseen Depths of a Media Mogul

Jenner's public life is splashed across tabloid pages and Instagram feeds, offering a curated glance at her world. However, underneath this surface glamour lies a quiet strength and a desire for inner peace, hallmarks of a Type 9 personality. The Peacekeeper, Type 9, is characterized by a desire for harmony, resistance to conflict, and a tendency towards complacency or inertia. Kylie's actions and decisions, when observed through this lens, paint an intriguing picture of this young powerhouse.

## The Desire for Harmony

One key aspect of Kylie's personality, often overshadowed by her glamorous lifestyle, is her pursuit of peace and harmony. This drive is evident in her role within her famous family. Despite the inevitable drama that accompanies their high-profile status, Kylie consistently seeks to maintain peace among her siblings, <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Kim-Kardashian">Kim</a> <a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Khloe-Kardashian">Khloé</a>, and
<a href="/blog/famous-enneagram-types/Kourtney-Kardashian">Kourtney</a>. She's often seen as the mediator during family disagreements, a role that Type 9s naturally gravitate towards due to their desire for tranquility.

## The Inertia of a Billionaire

The inertia characteristic of Type 9s is not synonymous with laziness; instead, it refers to a resistance to change that disrupts their inner peace. Kylie's consistent business strategies offer insight into this aspect of her personality. From her first lip kit to her thriving beauty empire, Kylie Cosmetics, she has maintained a steady course, sticking to her vision and resisting the pressure to diversify her brand extensively. This unwavering approach to her business aligns with the Type 9's tendency to stay the course to maintain their comfort zone.

## The Internal and External Disconnect

Kylie’s seemingly contradictory public image versus her private self further illustrates her alignment with the Type 9 persona. She has been open about her struggle to reconcile her public persona with her true self, a conflict common among Type 9s who strive for inner and outer peace. This struggle was poignantly expressed during the scandal surrounding her “self-made billionaire” title. Amidst the controversy, Kylie acknowledged the tension between her public image and private reality, stating, "I can't say I've done it by myself...But that's the category I fall under."

## Escaping into Peaceful Spaces

Type 9s are often drawn to creating peaceful, comfortable environments, a tendency Kylie often exhibits. Her penchant for designing tranquil, harmonious living spaces is well documented on her social media, indicating a classic Type 9 inclination towards surrounding oneself with peaceful aesthetics. Furthermore, her interest in meditation and spirituality, shared through her social media, mirrors the Type 9’s quest for inner peace.
