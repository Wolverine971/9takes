<!-- Notes: Gigi is most likely not a 1,3 or an 8. She is pretty meek and mild-- almost shy. Her mother pushed her to be a model and have a specific body type. There was also the fight between Zayn and her mom-- where she took her mother's side. I could see her as a 6-- although this is just based off the little I know. -->
