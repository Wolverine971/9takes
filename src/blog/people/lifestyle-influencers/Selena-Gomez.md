Selena Gomez, born in 1992, has evolved from a Disney Channel star to a multi-faceted artist and advocate. Her career trajectory reflects key Type 9 traits:

- **Chameleon-like Adaptability**: Selena's seamless transitions between acting, singing, and producing showcase the Type 9's flexibility.

Selena's struggles with anxiety and depression may stem from the Type 9's difficulty in acknowledging and expressing their own needs and emotions. This inner turmoil, often hidden from the public eye, reflects the Type 9's tendency to internalize conflict rather than confront it directly. Selena's documentary "My Mind & Me" offers a rare glimpse into this internal struggle, showcasing the Type 9's journey towards self-awareness.

### Connection Cravings: Selena's Type 9 Approach to Relationships and Fame

Her close relationships with friends and family reflect the Type 9's deep-seated fear of loss and desire for connection. In the entertainment industry, this manifests as loyalty to long-time friends and a preference for working with familiar teams.

This ability to adapt and blend is a hallmark of the Type 9, enabling Selena to thrive in various professional settings.
