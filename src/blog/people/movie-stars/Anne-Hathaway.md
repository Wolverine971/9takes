<p class="firstLetter">You've seen Anne Hathaway transform from a princess to a desperate mother to a fashion assistant. But have you ever wondered what drives her to dive so deeply into each role?</p>

The answer might lie in understanding her as an [Enneagram Type 1 – The Perfectionist](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-1).

Type 1s are driven by a deep desire to be good, to do things correctly, and to improve the world around them. They're guided by a strong inner critic that constantly evaluates their actions against their high standards.

But Anne isn't just any Type 1. She's a complex individual whose journey from Brooklyn kid to Oscar winner reveals a unique relationship with her perfectionist tendencies.

## "I Had to Be Perfect": Anne's Formative Years

Anne grew up in a household that valued principle and performance. Her father was a lawyer, her mother a former actress who once played Fantine in "Les Misérables" on stage – the very role Anne would later win an Oscar for.

"The fact that I played Fantine, the same part that my mother played in the first national tour, was unbelievable," Anne shared in a Vogue interview. It wasn't just coincidence – it was a daughter unconsciously seeking to perfect what came before her.

Growing up Catholic also shaped her moral framework. She attended Brooklyn Heights Montessori School and later Wyoming Elementary, where she developed the "good student" mindset that Type 1s often carry into adulthood.

But perfection has its price.

Anne has spoken openly about battling anxiety and depression as a teenager. "I suffered from anxiety and depression when I was 16," she once told Glamour. "I said to Mom the other day, 'Do you remember that girl? She has now gone, gone to sleep.'"

This struggle is common for Type 1s, whose inner critic can become overwhelming when they feel they're failing to meet their own impossible standards.

## The Inner World of a Perfectionist

What's going on inside Anne's head? More than you might think.

In interviews, she's offered glimpses into her thought process. During her Oscar acceptance speech preparation, she revealed practicing in front of the mirror repeatedly, trying to appear "grateful" rather than "overexcited."

This is classic Type 1 behavior – not just doing something, but doing it "the right way."

"I had to stand in front of a mirror and practice," she told the Guardian. "I thought, 'What if I made it about How Happy I Am instead of How Much It Means to Me?'"

Even in moments of triumph, the Type 1's inner critic is working overtime, analyzing not just what is said, but how it's conveyed.

Her "Princess Diaries" director Garry Marshall once noted, "She's like a thoroughbred – you need to hold her back because she works so hard and prepares so much."

That preparation comes from a place of anxiety about failing to meet her own standards.

## Transformations: The Physical and Mental Dedication

Remember when Anne lost 25 pounds for "Les Misérables"?

She didn't just diet – she committed to a transformation that would make her physically experience Fantine's desperation. "I had to be obsessive about it—the idea was to look near death," she told Vogue.

For "The Dark Knight Rises," she trained intensively for months to build the physical strength needed for Catwoman's stunts. Christopher Nolan remarked, "Anne's dedication to preparation was extraordinary. She understood the physical demands of the role immediately."

This isn't just about being a good actress. It's about a Type 1's need to embody their understanding of perfection in every aspect of their work.

"I like the gym," Anne has said. "I like to know that if my body needs to do something, it can."

Type 1s often hold themselves to standards that others might find extreme. But for Anne, these transformations aren't extreme – they're necessary to meet her internal standard of authenticity.

## When the World Criticized the Perfectionist: The "Hathahate" Era

Remember 2013? Anne won an Oscar for "Les Misérables" but simultaneously faced an unprecedented public backlash dubbed "Hathahate."

Critics and social media users called her "inauthentic" and "too perfect" – perhaps the most painful criticism possible for a Type 1, whose core fear is being corrupt, defective, or bad.

Her friend and "Les Misérables" co-star Hugh Jackman defended her: "She is the most dedicated, hardworking actress I've worked with. She's brilliant but she's also kind."

But the criticism cut deep. Anne retreated from public view for a time, later telling Harper's Bazaar: "I couldn't not equate myself with the hate that was being directed at me, and it was excruciating."

This period reveals how Type 1s can be deeply wounded by suggestions that their efforts to be good are somehow fake or unnatural.

Anne eventually found her way through. "Life's too short to be anyone but yourself," she told the Huffington Post years later. "I got too focused on the everythingness of it all."

A perfect Type 1 realization – sometimes, striving for perfection means missing the point entirely.

## "I Need to Make a Difference": Anne's Activism

Type 1s aren't just perfectionists for themselves – they want to improve the world.

Anne serves as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, focusing on parental leave policies and childcare services. "I feel like the cause chose me," she told Elle. "The moment we started talking I knew this was what I wanted to do."

Her commitment to environmental causes runs deep too. She's been spotted wearing sustainable fashion on red carpets and has spoken about making eco-conscious choices.

"I try to live by the rule that a good guide in making choices is to do what makes you feel good," she explained to InStyle.

For Anne, as with many Type 1s, doing good isn't separate from being good – it's an extension of her core values into the world around her.

## Motherhood: When Perfection Meets Unpredictability

Nothing challenges a perfectionist like parenthood – a realm where control is an illusion.

Anne has two sons with husband Adam Shulman, and motherhood has shifted her relationship with her Type 1 tendencies.

"Before I had my son, I sensed I was going to be a parent who was very good at beating myself up," she told Metro. "But I've started to see that perfectionism is a form of self-harm."

This realization represents significant growth for a Type 1, whose instinct is to criticize themselves for failing to meet impossible standards.

She's also fiercely protective of her children's privacy, rarely sharing photos or details – a principled stand in an era of social media oversharing.

"Privacy is the new currency," she once remarked. Another Type 1 characteristic: standing by your principles, even when it goes against trends.

## In the Company She Keeps: Relationships and Support Systems

Anne married Adam Shulman in 2012, and their relationship seems to provide the stability that Type 1s crave.

"He changed my ability to be in the world comfortably," she told Harper's Bazaar. For a Type 1 whose inner critic is always on alert, finding someone who helps quiet that voice is invaluable.

Her circle of friends includes long-term relationships rather than a constantly changing crowd – another Type 1 trait. They tend to value depth and authenticity in relationships.

Director Christopher Nolan has worked with her multiple times, perhaps recognizing the dedication she brings. "Anne has this incredible ability to seem like she's not acting," he said. "Every moment feels genuine."

Type 1s are drawn to people who appreciate their earnestness and effort, rather than seeing it as "too much."

## Daily Rituals: The Habits Behind the Excellence

Anne's preparation routines are legendary in Hollywood.

For "Rachel Getting Married," she spent time in rehabilitation facilities to understand addiction. For "The Devil Wears Prada," she shadowed a Vogue assistant for a week.

"I don't think anyone can emerge from Vogue unchanged," she joked afterward.

These aren't just acting techniques – they're manifestations of a Type 1's need for thoroughness and accuracy.

Her daily life includes meditation, which she's mentioned helps manage anxiety. "I try to take care of myself as much as possible," she told Shape magazine.

Type 1s often need practices that help quiet their inner critic, and mindfulness can provide that respite.

## Pride and Shame: The Type 1's Emotional Landscape

What makes Anne proudest isn't necessarily her awards.

"I'm proudest of the life I've built," she told Glamour. "The friends I have and the fact I treat people well."

For a Type 1, living according to your values is the greatest achievement.

As for regrets? The backlash to her Oscar hosting experience with James Franco remains a sore spot.

"It's an obvious thing, you win an Oscar and you're supposed to be happy. I didn't feel that way," she admitted to The Guardian.

This captures the Type 1's complex relationship with achievement – even success can feel hollow if you believe you've fallen short of your own standards.

## Evolution of a Principled Perfectionist

Today's Anne Hathaway seems more at peace with her perfectionist nature.

"I've realized that my expectations of perfection are exactly that – mine," she told InStyle in a recent interview. "They don't have to be anyone else's."

This represents the healthy growth path for Type 1s – learning that their standards are subjective, not universal truths.

What can we learn from Anne's journey?

Perhaps it's that striving for excellence isn't the problem – it's believing we must be flawless to be worthy. Anne's evolution shows that even the most driven perfectionists can find their way to self-compassion.

Understanding your own Enneagram type might offer similar insights. Are you driven by an inner critic like Anne? Or does another motivation shape your choices?

The beauty of the Enneagram isn't just identifying your type – it's recognizing the growth path it illuminates. For Anne, that path has led from rigid perfectionism to a more balanced excellence.

And that's a journey worth watching, both on screen and off.
