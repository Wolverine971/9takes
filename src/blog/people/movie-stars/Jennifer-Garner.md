## What Is Jennifer Garner's Personality Type?

### Type 1: The Perfectionist

Enneagram Type 1, often labeled as 'The Perfectionist,' is characterized by a strong sense of right and wrong, a deep commitment to improvement, and an underlying drive for integrity and balance. These individuals are often detail-oriented, conscientious, and hold themselves to high standards. But what makes Jennifer Garner a quintessential Type 1?

## Garner's Drive for Perfection and Integrity

From her breakout role as a no-nonsense spy in "Alias" to her heartwarming portrayal in "13 Going on 30," Garner has consistently displayed strength, empathy, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

### Stressors and Motivations

Type 1 personalities, like Garner, are often driven by an internal critic, striving for perfection in everything they do. Garner's meticulous preparation for roles and passionate involvement in philanthropic causes reflect this trait. She has been known to immerse herself completely in her characters, seeking to portray them with utmost authenticity.

### Garner's Personal Struggles and Triumphs

Garner's public separation and subsequent divorce from Ben Affleck provided a rare glimpse into her personal vulnerabilities.
