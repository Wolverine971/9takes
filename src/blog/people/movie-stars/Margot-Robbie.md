## So, What Is Margot Robbie’s Personality Type?

### Margot Robbie is an Enneagram Type 2

A Type 2, known as The Helper, is distinguished by their empathetic nature, unreserved desire to connect with others, and propensity for selflessness. These individuals tend to be generous, demonstrative, people-pleasing, and possessive. But how does this relate to Margot Robbie? Let's delve into some compelling evidence pointing towards her Type 2 personality.

#### The Empathy of a Helper

Robbie’s immersion into her characters goes beyond the call of acting. From Tonya Harding in "I, Tonya" to Queen Elizabeth I in "Mary Queen of Scots", she empathizes with the characters she portrays, expressing a desire to understand their inner world. This empathetic approach echoes the Type 2's inclination to connect with others.

#### Generosity Off-Screen

Away from the silver screen, Robbie has demonstrated the generosity characteristic of a Type 2. She is known to give back to her community, having funded the education of young girls in India and supported Time's Up, a movement against sexual harassment. This charitable inclination aligns with the giving nature of The Helper.

#### Possessiveness and Its Trappings

While Type 2’s are generally seen as selfless, they can also become possessive. An interview with Vogue reveals Robbie's strong attachment to her private life and the possessive stance she takes against intrusion, illustrating the Type 2’s struggle with personal boundaries and their possessive nature.

#### The Desire for Love and Appreciation

Margot Robbie’s struggle with impostor syndrome, as she confessed in an interview, reflects a Type 2’s underlying desire to be loved and appreciated. Type 2 individuals often grapple with feelings of being unworthy of love and resort to giving more of themselves as a coping mechanism.

#### Cracking Under Pressure: A Peek into Controversies

The “Vanity Fair” article controversy in 2016 saw Robbie at the epicenter of a maelstrom. She was criticized and objectified for her beauty rather than her talent. But instead of escalating the situation, she dealt with it gracefully, demonstrating the Type 2’s strength in maintaining harmony even under stress.

## How Margot personality comes out in her work

Margot Robbie's powerful performances are a testament to her artistry. But they also provide glimpses into her personality and her Type 2 Enneagram alignment, revealing how Robbie's personal values and traits manifest in the characters she portrays. Let's examine two of her most memorable roles.

### Harley Quinn - "Suicide Squad" and "Birds of Prey"

Harley Quinn, Robbie's iconic role in "Suicide Squad" and "Birds of Prey", may seem like an unlikely reflection of her Type 2 personality at first glance. Harley is anarchic and unpredictable, but her defining characteristic, as portrayed by Robbie, is her unwavering dedication to those she loves. Despite her tumultuous relationship with the Joker, Harley’s loyalty and her instinct to help him, even at her own expense, reveals the Enneagram Type 2's propensity for self-sacrifice and their underlying desire to feel loved and appreciated.

### Tonya Harding - "I, Tonya"

In "I, Tonya", Robbie masterfully embodies the role of Tonya Harding, a former figure skater whose life and career were marred by controversy. The complexity of Harding’s character allowed Robbie to tap into her Type 2 traits. Harding, caught in a cycle of love and abuse, was driven by an intense desire for acceptance and recognition, reflecting Type 2's fear of being unwanted. Robbie's empathetic portrayal humanized Harding, highlighting the Type 2's ability to connect with and understand others' pain.
