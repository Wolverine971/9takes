They are natural leaders, bold, passionate, practical, and often have a formidable presence. They tend to exhibit an intense energy that commands attention and respect.

#### Unraveling the Enneagram 8 in Margot Robbie

Margot Robbie's life and career provide evidence of her being a Type 8.

#### A Willingness to Confront and Embrace anger

Type 8 personalities are not afraid to confront conflicts head-on, and neither is Robbie. She has passionately embraced intense emotions and controversy in many of her roles. Her portrayal of Tonya Harding, an Olympic figure skater entangled in a scandal, demonstrated her ability to channel her anger into her performance, making it a raw and gripping experience for viewers.

#### From Australian Soap to Hollywood: A True Challenger's Journey

Margot Robbie's journey from an Australian soap opera to the heights of Hollywood encapsulates the determination and resilience of an Enneagram Type 8. She has successfully navigated the challenges of the film industry, asserting her talent and ambition in the face of adversity – traits synonymous with a Type 8 personality.

## How Margot's personality comes out in her work

Margot Robbie's Enneagram Type 8 personality is unmistakably mirrored in her professional work. Her carefully chosen roles testify to her inherent attributes, as they often align with her natural assertiveness, tenacity, and will to protect what she holds dear. Distinct examples include her roles in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “I, Tonya,” and the “Suicide Squad” franchise.

### Naomi Lapaglia in "The Wolf of Wall Street"

In “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Robbie stepped into the shoes of Naomi Lapaglia, a character as bold and assertive as she is. Naomi's audacity and refusal to be dominated even by her powerful husband echo the core traits of Type 8. The strength and independence she portrays mirror Robbie's inner world and her alignment with this Enneagram type.

### Tonya Harding in "I, Tonya"

Robbie's depiction of Tonya Harding, the professional ice skater caught in a storm of controversy, in “I, Tonya” provides another illuminating instance of her Enneagram Type 8 alignment. Harding's real-life portrayal as someone unafraid to express her anger and face conflicts aligns closely with a Type 8's comfortable confrontation with rage. The storyline's journey through adversity and struggle for control and respect mirror the common life challenges of Type 8 individuals. Robbie's fearless performance here further illustrates her understanding and embodiment of her inner Type 8.

### Harley Quinn in "Suicide Squad" and "Birds of Prey"

Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn, especially in "Birds of Prey," vividly embodies her Enneagram Type 8 traits. Harley Quinn's high energy, rebelliousness, and fierce independence align seamlessly with Robbie's assertive and tenacious Type 8 personality.

Her transformation from the Joker's sidekick to an independent, rule-setting leading figure mirrors the Type 8 journey from vulnerability to control and autonomy. This narrative reflects Robbie's path in Hollywood as she establishes herself as a force to be reckoned with.

Robbie's portrayal transcends acting; it's an exploration of her Enneagram Type 8 attributes. Through Harley Quinn, Robbie paints a vivid picture of her inner world, expressing her strength, resilience, and rebellion. Harley becomes an extension of Robbie, providing a window into her Type 8 personality.
