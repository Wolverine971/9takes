<p class="firstLetter">Marilyn Monroe was an iconic Hollywood actress and cultural icon of the 1950s and 1960s. While her life was cut short, her legacy lives on as a symbol of beauty, glamour, and sex appeal. But beneath her public image, there was a vulnerable and insecure person who struggled with anxiety and self-doubt. In this blog, we will explore why Marilyn Monroe was an Enneagram Type 6 and how this personality type influenced her life and career.</p>

## Fear and Anxiety

Enneagram Type 6 is often referred to as the Loyalist or the Questioner, and fear is the central emotion that drives their behavior. This fear can manifest in different ways, such as anxiety, self-doubt, and a need for security and stability. Marilyn Monroe's life was marked by anxiety and fear, which were exacerbated by her childhood experiences and traumatic events. Her fear of abandonment and rejection led her to seek the approval of others and to maintain close relationships ðŸ’‘ with people she trusted.

## Need for Support and Guidance

Enneagram Type 6 also has a strong need for support and guidance from others. They tend to seek out authority figures and mentors who can provide them with a sense of direction and security. Marilyn Monroe was no exception, as she had several relationships with older men who played a fatherly or mentor role in her life. One of these men was Lee Strasberg, the founder of the Actors Studio, who became a close friend and acting coach for Marilyn. She also had a close relationship with her psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, whom she trusted and relied on for emotional support.

## Seeking Validation and Acceptance

Enneagram Type 6 also seeks validation and acceptance from others, which can lead to a tendency to conform to social norms and expectations. Marilyn Monroe's public image was carefully crafted to appeal to mainstream audiences, and she often struggled to balance her private self with her public persona. She was aware of the importance of her image and worked hard to maintain it, even when it conflicted with her personal beliefs or desires.

## Inner Turmoil and Insecurity

Enneagram Type 6 also experiences inner turmoil and insecurity, which can manifest in different ways, such as self-doubt, indecisiveness, and a need for reassurance. Marilyn Monroe's personal life was marked by tumultuous relationships, including her marriages to Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller, which were marked by conflict and instability. She also struggled with substance abuse and depression, which were likely linked to her underlying anxiety and insecurity.
