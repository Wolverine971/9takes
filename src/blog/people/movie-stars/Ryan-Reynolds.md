> "There's nothing my brothers and I didn't put a hole in. We turned our home into a Wiffle house." — Ryan Reynolds

<p class="firstLetter">If you're a Ryan Reynolds fan, you've probably fallen for his quick wit, charming smile, and that unmistakable ability to make you laugh until your sides hurt.</p>

But have you ever wondered what makes him tick? What drives the man who can switch from sarcastic Deadpool to devoted father of four without missing a beat? The answer might lie in understanding his personality type — and it's one that explains why we all feel like we could grab a beer with him, even though he's one of Hollywood's biggest stars.

## What is Ryan Reynolds' Personality Type?

### Ryan Reynolds is an Enneagram Type 7 (The Enthusiast)

[Type 7s](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7) are the adventurers of the Enneagram world — playful, energetic, and always chasing the next exciting experience. They're driven by a core desire to be happy and content, while harboring a deep fear of being trapped in pain or deprivation. For a Type 7, the world is full of possibilities waiting to be explored, and they'll do almost anything to avoid feeling stuck or bored.

Sound familiar? If you've watched Ryan's career trajectory from sitcom actor to superhero to business mogul, you're seeing a classic Type 7 in action — someone who craves variety, takes risks, and uses humor to navigate life's challenges. But Ryan's version of Type 7 is uniquely his own, shaped by his upbringing, his struggles, and a depth that many miss beneath the surface jokes.

## Growing Up Reynolds: The Making of an Enthusiast

Ryan's childhood in Vancouver, Canada, with three older brothers and a former cop father, created the perfect environment for a Type 7 personality to develop. Growing up as the youngest of four boys meant constantly fighting for attention and finding creative ways to stand out. In his own words, their home became "a Wiffle house" — filled with holes from their endless adventures and misadventures.

His father, Jim Reynolds, was a tough, disciplined former police officer who expected excellence. "My dad was tough. He wasn't easy on anyone. And he wasn't easy on himself," Ryan has shared. This dynamic likely contributed to young Ryan developing the classic Type 7 coping mechanism — using humor and excitement to escape discomfort and potential pain.

Being surrounded by three older brothers who constantly tested and teased him helped Ryan develop his quick wit as both shield and sword. He learned to deflect emotional vulnerability with humor and to seek out fun and excitement rather than dwell on difficult emotions. As he told Rolling Stone UK in 2022, it was during these formative years that he developed his frenetic energy and ability to make others laugh — two hallmark Type 7 traits that would later define his public persona.

## From Vancouver to Deadpool: A Type 7's Journey

Type 7s are notorious for their ability to reinvent themselves and pursue varied interests — something Ryan has demonstrated throughout his career. From his early days in the teen soap "Hillside" to romantic comedies like "The Proposal" to the massive success of "Deadpool," Reynolds has never allowed himself to be boxed in. This refusal to be typecast is classic Type 7 behavior, driven by their fear of limitation and love of new experiences.

The Deadpool franchise perfectly showcases Ryan's Type 7 energy. After the disappointment of "Green Lantern," most actors might have avoided superhero films altogether. But instead of retreating, Ryan doubled down and fought for over a decade to bring his vision of Deadpool to the screen. It was a massive risk that paid off spectacularly — demonstrating the Type 7's optimism, persistence, and ability to turn setbacks into opportunities.

His co-star Morena Baccarin noted, "What makes Ryan so perfect for Deadpool is that his mind works at this incredible pace. He's always thinking of the next joke, the next line, constantly improvising." This rapid-fire thinking style is quintessential Type 7 — they process information quickly and are always looking ahead to the next possibility.

## Inside Ryan's Mind: The Type 7's Inner World

### The Comedy Shield

Ryan's famous sense of humor isn't just a personality trait — it's a sophisticated coping mechanism typical of Type 7s. When asked about his anxiety in interviews, Reynolds has been remarkably candid: "I feel like I have two parts of my personality, that one takes over when that curtain opens. I'm not good at that. I'm really bad at that, I've had it my whole life."

This duality he describes — the anxious Ryan versus the confident performer — perfectly illustrates how Type 7s use positive experiences and humor to escape their inner fears. For Ryan, comedy isn't just his career; it's his armor against the anxiety he's battled since childhood.

### The Perpetual Motion Machine

Type 7s are known for their tendency to overcommit and stay constantly busy — another way of avoiding uncomfortable emotions. Ryan has admitted to this pattern: "I tend to pave over anxiety with work and, to a lesser extent, achievement." This self-awareness about using accomplishments as distraction is rare, even for a Type 7.

As a Hollywood A-lister, Aviation Gin owner, Mint Mobile investor, and co-owner of Wrexham AFC soccer club, Ryan maintains a schedule that would exhaust most people. This isn't just ambition — it's a Type 7's way of staying one step ahead of their fears and insecurities. By filling every moment with projects and possibilities, they create a life where there's simply no time for pain to catch up.

### The Family Anchor

Where Ryan diverges from the stereotypical Type 7 is in his deep commitment to family life. While Type 7s are often characterized as commitment-phobic, Ryan has found in his wife Blake Lively and their four children a grounding force that balances his enthusiastic nature.

"I used to say I would take a bullet for you. Now I would never do that because I would use you as a human shield," he once joked about parenting, displaying the classic Type 7 tendency to use humor to express deep love. Behind the joke is a profound truth: Ryan has found that family provides the security and fulfillment that Type 7s secretly crave beneath their adventure-seeking exterior.

## Ryan's Entrepreneurial Spirit: Type 7 in Business

Ryan's business ventures reveal another dimension of his Type 7 personality. From Aviation Gin (which he sold for a reported $610 million) to his stake in Mint Mobile and ownership of Wrexham AFC, Ryan approaches business with the same creative energy he brings to acting.

His marketing strategies for Aviation Gin showcase Type 7 ingenuity at its finest. Rather than traditional advertising, Ryan created viral videos that felt more like entertainment than commercials. This approach — blending humor, creativity, and a refusal to follow conventional rules — is exactly how a Type 7 would approach business.

When CNBC asked about his business success, Ryan explained, "Creativity has been the most important tool in my life, in business, in parenting, in everything." This statement encapsulates the Type 7 belief that there's always another angle, another approach, another solution waiting to be discovered.

## The Anxiety Behind the Smile

Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Ryan's personality is his openness about anxiety — something many Type 7s experience but few discuss publicly. In a 2018 New York Times interview, he shared, "I have anxiety. I've always had anxiety. Both in the lighthearted 'I'm anxious about this' kind of thing, and I've been to the depths of the darker end of the spectrum, which is not fun."

This vulnerability reveals the shadow side of the Type 7 personality. While they project confidence and joy, many Type 7s like Ryan struggle internally with anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Their frenetic pace and pursuit of positive experiences often serve as sophisticated defense mechanisms against these darker feelings.

Ryan's admission that he "would conduct interviews by day and spend the evenings in the emergency room" during the press tour for the first Deadpool film shows just how intense this anxiety can become. It also demonstrates the classic Type 7 pattern of pushing forward through pain, refusing to be limited by fear.

## Growing Through Challenges: Ryan's Evolving Type 7

What makes Ryan particularly interesting as a Type 7 is his self-awareness and growth. Where many Type 7s spend their lives running from pain, Ryan has learned to acknowledge and even discuss his struggles openly. This willingness to face difficult emotions represents significant personal development for a Type 7.

His involvement with Wrexham AFC exemplifies this evolution. Rather than pursuing a flashy sports team for excitement alone, Ryan and co-owner Rob McElhenney chose a struggling club in a working-class Welsh town. They've committed to a long-term project of community building that requires patience and persistence — not typically Type 7 strengths.

As Ryan told The Athletic, "The thing that gets me up in the morning is that community and the passion they have for this sport and this team." This focus on connection and meaning rather than just excitement suggests a maturing Type 7 who has discovered deeper sources of fulfillment.

## The Legacy of an Enthusiast

What Ryan Reynolds shows us is that Type 7s can channel their natural enthusiasm and creativity into lasting impact. Through his businesses, philanthropic efforts, and willingness to discuss mental health, Ryan has created a legacy that goes beyond entertainment.

Most recently, his work with the Sick Kids Foundation and his $250,000 donation to Influence Mentoring, which supports Indigenous youth, demonstrate how Type 7s can use their platforms for meaningful change. These aren't the actions of someone merely seeking the next thrill — they show a depth of purpose that represents the highest potential of the Type 7 personality.

As Ryan continues to evolve as an actor, businessman, and family man, we're witnessing a Type 7 coming into full integration — balancing his natural enthusiasm with depth, commitment, and purpose. For fans who've followed his journey from "Van Wilder" to "Deadpool" to Wrexham owner, the growth is evident and inspiring.
