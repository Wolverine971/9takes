<p class="firstLetter">In a music industry filled with calculated personas, **Doechii** stands apart as a force of genuine exuberance and creative freedom.</p>

The Grammy-winning rapper's meteoric rise from Tampa outsider to Billboard Woman of the Year isn't just a story of talent—it's what happens when an [Enneagram Type 7](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-7) fully embraces their natural gifts.

Through her ever-evolving artistic journey, Doechii embodies the pure essence of "The Enthusiast"—chasing experiences, transforming pain into empowerment, and refusing to stay still in any creative box.

## From Bullied Kid to "This Is My Motherf\*\*\*ing Movie": How Doechii's Type 7 Spirit Was Born

Born Jaylah Ji'mya Hickmon in 1998, Doechii's early life in Tampa was a whirlwind of creativity nurtured by her mother Celesia Moore. Though money was tight, her mom "spent her last dime on anything I wanted to do and try," Doechii recalls—even as young Jaylah **picked up and quit countless different activities** in true Enthusiast fashion.

Music was everywhere. Her father, local rapper Snatcha Da Boss, remembers baby Jaylah banging on drums "before she could even walk," while her home vibrated with sounds from Lauryn Hill to Southern hip-hop.

Yet beneath this rich creative environment lurked a painful reality. By sixth grade, relentless bullying had pushed the young girl to her breaking point. At just 10 or 11 years old, Doechii attempted suicide—a dark moment she now boldly calls a "blessing in disguise."

Why?

Because in the aftermath came the epiphany that would change everything.

"I realized, 'Oh, f**_, I'm gonna kill myself and then I'm gonna be the only one dead. The bullies aren't gonna be with me... everything they said is not coming with me either,'" she revealed. In that moment, defiance flooded in: "And then I was like, 'F_** that! F**_ that s_**! I'm not going for that!'"

A wave of peace and clarity washed over her as she received an almost divine message: **"I am Doechii."**

This wasn't just a name change—it was the birth of her authentic self. "I had to find a reason to live," she reflects. "I realized I didn't hate myself. I didn't believe what everybody else believed about me, so why did I take it so personally?"

In classic Type 7 fashion, she confronted her **fear of being trapped in pain** head-on and chose the opposite path: **embracing life in full color**. She made a **conscious choice to be the "main character"** of her own story: "I am the most important character in this movie. This is my motherf\*\*\*ing movie."

## The Enthusiast Unleashed: Doechii's High School Reinvention

With this newfound freedom, Doechii entered Howard W. Blake High School for the arts with a liberating mindset.

"I told myself, when I go to [high school], nobody's gonna know who I am or where I'm from. I can be gay, I can be weird, I can sing, I can listen to rock music... I can do whatever. I can be myself," she recalls.

And she meant _whatever_.

She "went full throttle"—experimenting with fashion, joining a gospel girl group (briefly, of course—Type 7s rarely stick with one thing), and eventually diving into Tampa's underground music scene.

A pivotal friendship with an artist named Taylor introduced her to home recording—"I thought you had to be a superstar to record. I didn't know there were home studios," Doechii remembers. "She had one and that changed my whole life."

That lightbulb moment perfectly captures the Type 7 spirit: **Why wait for permission to create when you can do it yourself?**

Soon, the teenager was skipping school to record songs in a friend's bedroom, fueled by weed, rebellion, and **boundless creative excitement**. Her first SoundCloud song "El Chapo" showcased the very versatility that would become her signature. "After that, it was over," she says—there was no turning back.

## "Yucky Blucky Fruitcake": When Doechii's Inner Child Found Its Voice

After high school, Doechii faced the "real world"—a challenge to her free-spirited nature. She bounced between odd jobs (getting fired from multiple gigs in retail, fast food, even a library) and chased opportunity to NYC for a failed audition on _The Voice_.

Rather than defeat her, being "stuck" in New York became an adventure. She couch-surfed, worked at Zara, and performed in small Brooklyn venues, until an old friend's encouragement—"You're good enough to get signed"—ignited her next chapter.

Back in Tampa, Doechii self-released her debut EP **Coven Music Session, Vol. 1** in 2019, followed by **Oh The Places You'll Go** in 2020 (named after the Dr. Seuss book—fitting for an imaginative journeyer like her).

That second EP featured a track that would change her life: **"Yucky Blucky Fruitcake."**

In this song, Doechii let her **inner child** run wild. The track is a playful, diaristic rundown of her quirks and the very "weird girl" traits that once made her feel like an outsider.

\*"In my black Taylor Chucks, the ones laced up to my thighs / Lisa Frank lipstick on my eyes / Weird girl activity, Black b*\*\*h nativity…"* she raps, painting a picture of an alternative Black girl aesthetic as proudly bizarre as it is authentic.

Though she knew the song was "corny... very cake pop," that was entirely by design. After the heavy emotional labor of her first EP, Doechii consciously wanted to make something light, literal, and digestible.

And it worked. In 2021, **"Yucky Blucky Fruitcake" went viral on TikTok**, sparking an empowering glow-up challenge where users showed "before and after" photos of their own transformations (from awkward kid to confident adult, from closeted to proudly queer, and so on).

As a psychological moment, this was significant: Doechii had flipped her long-held avoidance of painful self-disclosure into a bold form of **self-expression therapy**. By owning her "uncool" side in a fun way, she helped both herself and her listeners laugh at, and ultimately embrace, the very things they once felt ashamed of.

## The Enthusiast Meets the Industry: Finding Her Tribe at TDE

The viral success of "Yucky Blucky Fruitcake" was the kind of explosive _new experience_ a Type 7 lives for. Practically overnight, **record labels came calling**.

But Doechii didn't want to be _trapped_ by anyone's expectations. "A lot of labels didn't impress me with their lack of integrity," she recalls, noting how most came with a pre-packaged plan for "how they thought my career would go."

Then **Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE)** came knocking in early 2022, and _everything_ changed. Unlike the others, TDE's team asked _her_ what **her** vision was. That collaborative approach, plus the label's legendary roster (home to Kendrick Lamar and SZA), sealed the deal.

In March 2022, Doechii signed with TDE and Capitol Records, making headlines as the **first female rapper ever signed to TDE**. It was a historic moment—and a hugely validating one for the girl who once doubted she'd ever fit in.

What followed was a whirlwind:

- By mid-2022, she released the bold EP **She / Her / Black B\***h\*\*
- Her song **"Persuasive"** landed on former President Obama's summer playlist
- SZA jumped on the "Persuasive" remix and publicly declared Doechii "my favorite artist, hands down... f\*\*k the genre"
- She made her TV debut on _The Tonight Show_, wowed at Coachella, and at one Billboard Women in Music event, **danced so hard she literally flew out of her shoe** (and still finished the routine unfazed)

By 2023, she had her first **Billboard Hot 100** hit with **"What It Is (Block Boy)"** featuring Kodak Black, and made her **acting debut** in A24's critically acclaimed drama _Earth Mama_.

The crowning achievement came in February 2025 when her mixtape _Alligator Bites Never Heal_ won the **Grammy Award for Best Rap Album**. Around the same time, Billboard named her **Woman of the Year (2025)**. A month later, she released **"Anxiety"** which hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting hit to date.

## Inside Doechii's Mind: The Type 7's Creative Universe

If one thing is constant in Doechii's universe, it is **change**. She thrives on **variety and stimulation** in her creative process. "I like to write in parks, go to different restaurants and get inspiration, or visit a museum," she says of how she sparks her songwriting muse.

Being cooped up in windowless studios makes her feel stagnant, so she built a home studio for herself. _"People in the studios are smoking weed and s\*\*t… there's just this pressure to be a rapper. But when I'm home, I feel like I'm Jaylah... I don't feel pressure to perform,"_ she explains.

This self-awareness is key: as an Enthusiast, Doechii knows she creates best when she **feels free and unjudged**, able to flit between ideas and moods without constraint.

Her musical range proves this point. Hip-hop, R&B, pop, house, punk, soul—she's tried it all, often blending styles in the same track. She wants music that "feel[s] like rap, but still be fun, but tell a real story and have a very clear message… I want people to shake their asses but also cry a little bit."

In true Type 7 form, she wants **everything at once**—bops and depth, party and poetry. Why choose one when you can have the full spectrum?

## The Shadow Side: When Enthusiasts Face Their Pain

Underneath Doechii's sparkle, like all Type 7s, lies the shadow of pain avoidance. Yet her journey shows remarkable growth in this area.

When making her debut album dragged on longer than expected, she admits she spiraled into self-doubt: _"Can you make an album if it's taking you like two years? Can you even rap anymore? Who are you?"_ she asked herself.

The delay of gratification was uncomfortable—a classic Type 7 struggle is _impatience_ with anything that feels like stagnation. But finishing the album brought a new wave of confidence. \*"Now that it's done, I'm like, 'B*\*\*h, I'm an artist!'"* she exclaimed, finally feeling "much more secure" in herself.

In her song **"Anxiety,"** Doechii shows her willingness to tackle heavier feelings head-on. Originally a raw YouTube demo from 2019, the track is an exploration of her internal anxiety set over an unconventional beat (sampling Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know").

Critics noted that in the lyrics, "the listener could find Doechii working towards self-forgiveness, embracing a rounded maturity." Rather than avoid the topic of anxiety—something an earlier version of Doechii might have danced around—she put it front and center, and did so in a song that still _slaps_.

Doechii's response to having anxiety was to create with it, not in spite of it. And the universe seemed to reward her authenticity: "Anxiety" became her first top 10 hit in the U.S.

## What Makes This Enthusiast Unique: Doechii's Special Type 7 Flavor

While all Type 7s share core traits, Doechii expresses her Enthusiast nature in distinctive ways:

**Her relationship with pain**: Unlike some 7s who might numb themselves with substances or sabotage relationships to avoid feeling trapped, Doechii channels her avoidant energy into **productive creation and self-improvement**. Her suicide attempt in childhood became a transformative moment rather than a destructive one.

**Her creative discipline**: While Type 7s can have a reputation for being scattered, Doechii has shown remarkable focus in her career trajectory. She hustled in NYC, returned to Tampa with purpose, and methodically built her career step by step—showing that her enthusiasm doesn't come at the expense of dedication.

**Her openness to vulnerability**: Though Type 7s typically avoid painful emotions, Doechii increasingly incorporates her struggles into her art. From "Yucky Blucky Fruitcake" to "Anxiety," she's finding ways to transform her wounds into wisdom without losing her signature joy.

**Her balance of individuality and collaboration**: Doechii maintains her unique vision while still thriving in collaborative spaces (like TDE). She values creative freedom but doesn't isolate herself—a healthy evolution beyond the potential Type 7 pitfall of rejecting all structure.

## Why Doechii Resonates: The Enthusiast as Cultural Icon

For fans, Doechii is not only an entertainer but also something of a folk hero of self-actualization. Her journey offers several universal lessons:

**Pain can be transformative**: Rather than letting bullying destroy her, she created an entirely new self-concept that embraced her uniqueness.

**Authenticity attracts authentic support**: By refusing to compromise her vision with labels who didn't get it, she found her perfect home at TDE.

**Joy and healing can coexist**: Her music proves you can process trauma while still creating art that makes people dance and smile.

**Genre boundaries are illusions**: Her refusal to be boxed into one sound mirrors her refusal to be boxed in as a person.

## The Future Through a Type 7 Lens: Doechii's Next Chapter

True to her nature, Doechii celebrated her Grammy win in an unconventional way—by immediately dropping a **surprise track** called "Nosebleeds" the week after, just because she "felt like it." It was yet another new sound from her, a gift to fans hungry for more.

By the spring of 2025, she was already teasing her next creative era, hinting at a debut _album_ that will tie together everything she's experienced so far.

One gets the sense that for Doechii, _arrival_ is an illusion; it's all about the journey, the _next_ chapter, the next song, the next thrill. As she puts it, "when I die, I want to be happy. I want to know that I did everything I could."

It's a credo that could come straight from an Enthusiast's manifesto: life is finite, so don't waste a second trapped by fear or sorrow.

In her own words, she's made her choice: "This is my movie." The rest of us are just lucky to watch the plot unfold. And if there's one thing we know about this particular main character, it's that the next act will be **even more thrilling**, heartfelt, and unpredictable than the last—the quintessential Enthusiast, writing her story in real time, set to a beat we can all dance to.
