## Miley Cyrus: The Enthusiast?

Enneagram Type 7s, often known as 'The Enthusiast,' are generally extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. They are playful, high-spirited, and practical, but can also be scattered and undisciplined. A Type 7's core desire is to be satisfied and content—to have their needs fulfilled.

Looking at Miley's dynamic career trajectory and flamboyant lifestyle, these characteristics seem strikingly familiar. Known for her enthusiastic embrace of change, Miley's music career has evolved dramatically over the years, transitioning from the Disney Channel's Hannah Montana to a provocative pop icon. Her frequent transformation, arguably, mirrors a Type 7's desire for variety and adventure.

Miley's love for life and her pursuit of excitement and experiences are indicative of the typical Type 7's fear of being deprived and in pain. Her ongoing dedication to experience and live life to the fullest aligns closely with a Type 7's inherent need to keep exploring and experiencing new things.

Her controversy-laden journey also provides insight into her personality. For instance, the 2013 MTV VMAs saw Miley courting significant controversy with her performance. Rather than retreating, she embraced the criticism and controversy, demonstrating the fearlessness and resilience typical of a Type 7 personality.

## The Struggle of a Type 7

Type 7 personalities often avoid experiencing negative feelings, a pattern that can be seen in Miley's life. She seems to prefer focusing on the future and the next big thrill instead of dwelling on past controversies.

Take, for instance, the aftermath of her much-publicized split from actor Liam Hemsworth. While heartbreak might have driven others into seclusion, Miley used the experience as a catalyst for creativity, producing her album "Plastic Hearts," an embodiment of her resilience, optimism, and forward-focused mentality.

As we dissect these facets of Miley Cyrus's persona, her alignment with a Type 7 Enneagram seems conceivable.
