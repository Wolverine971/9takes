## Understand Miley Cyrus's Enneagram Type 4 Personality the Individualist

Enneagram Type 4, also known as "The Individualist," is characterized by a deep desire to be unique and authentic. The core motivations of Type 4 include:

- To be understood and appreciated for their uniqueness
- To express themselves authentically
- To find meaning and significance in life

Their core fears include:

- Being ordinary or mundane
- Having no identity or personal significance
- Being abandoned or rejected for being themselves

Miley Cyrus exemplifies these Type 4 traits in various aspects of her life and career. Her constant reinvention and bold self-expression reflect her desire to be unique and authentic. In interviews, Miley has often expressed feelings of being misunderstood, a common sentiment among Type 4s. For instance, she once said, **"People try to make everyone something. You can just start with being yourself."** This statement encapsulates the Type 4's struggle against conformity and their quest for authenticity.

Miley's fear of being ordinary is evident in her dramatic career shifts and headline-grabbing behavior. From her transition out of her Disney persona to her provocative "Wrecking Ball" era, Miley has consistently pushed boundaries, refusing to be boxed into a single identity.

## A Lyrical Journey: How Miley's Music Reflects Her Type 4 Traits

How does Miley use her music to convey her innermost feelings?

Miley's music and lyrics are a window into her Type 4 personality. Her songs often explore themes of identity, emotional depth, and the struggle to be understood – all hallmarks of Type 4.

In "The Climb," one of her earlier hits, Miley sings:

> "There's always gonna be another mountain
> I'm always gonna wanna make it move
> Always gonna be an uphill battle
> Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose"

These lyrics reflect the Type 4's ongoing journey of self-discovery and their resilience in the face of challenges. The song embodies the Type 4's belief that struggle and hardship are necessary parts of life and personal growth.

Her more recent work continues to showcase Type 4 themes. In "Midnight Sky," Miley declares:

> "I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
> I don't need to be loved by you"

This lyric encapsulates the Type 4's desire for independence and authenticity, even at the cost of belonging. It's a bold statement of self-reliance and individuality.

In "Mother's Daughter," Miley asserts:

> "Don't fuck with my freedom
> I came back to get me some
> I'm nasty, I'm evil
> Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter"

These lyrics showcase the Type 4's defiance against societal norms and their embrace of their perceived "darkness" or complexity. It's a celebration of the parts of oneself that others might reject or misunderstand.

## The Quest for Authenticity: Miley on Identity and Self-Perception

Miley has been candid about her journey of self-discovery and identity, offering insights that align closely with Type 4 characteristics. In various interviews, she has shared:

**"I'm not a superhero. I'm not anything more than any other person that's out there trying to figure it out."** This quote reflects the Type 4's tendency to feel different from others while simultaneously grappling with feelings of inadequacy.

On her constant evolution, Miley has said, **"I'm just a creative person who is constantly reinventing themselves."** This statement embodies the Type 4's desire for continuous self-expression and reinvention.

Addressing her public image, Miley once remarked, **"I don't really think about what someone is going to think when I make a decision. I make decisions based on what's going to make me happy."** This attitude aligns with the Type 4's prioritization of authenticity over social acceptance.

## Navigating Stress and Criticism: Miley's Type 4 Coping Mechanisms

Type 4s often struggle with criticism and stress, feeling things deeply and sometimes spiraling into self-doubt. Miley's coping mechanisms offer insight into how a Type 4 might navigate these challenges.

1. **Embracing Vulnerability**: Miley has been open about her struggles with mental health and substance abuse. In 2020, she shared on Instagram, **"I've been sober sober for the past six months. At the beginning, it was just about this vocal surgery... But I had been thinking a lot about my mother. My mom was adopted, and I inherited some of the feelings she had, the abandonment feelings and wanting to prove that you're wanted and valuable."** This openness about her challenges is typical of Type 4s, who often find strength in acknowledging their vulnerabilities.

2. **Creative Expression**: Like many Type 4s, Miley channels her emotions into her art. She has often spoken about how creating music helps her process her feelings. After her divorce from Liam Hemsworth, she released "Slide Away," a song that directly addressed the end of their relationship. This use of art as an emotional outlet is a common Type 4 coping strategy.

3. **Self-Reflection and Growth**: Miley has shown a willingness to learn from criticism and grow. After facing backlash for cultural appropriation earlier in her career, she acknowledged her mistakes and worked to educate herself. This ability to reflect and evolve is a healthy trait for Type 4s.

4. **Embracing Individuality**: In the face of criticism, Miley often doubles down on her unique identity. After facing controversy for her provocative performances, she stated, **"I'm just having fun. I'm just being myself."** This defiance in the face of criticism is typical of Type 4s, who resist conformity even under pressure.

5. **Seeking Deeper Connections**: Type 4s often cope with stress by seeking meaningful connections. Miley has spoken about the importance of her close relationships, particularly with her family. She once said, **"The best thing about my family is that even when I'm not feeling so good or not feeling my best, I have a whole team around me to support me."** This reliance on deep, supportive relationships is a common Type 4 trait.

By understanding Miley's personality through the lens of Enneagram Type 4, we gain insight not just into her behavior and career choices, but also into the internal motivations and fears that drive her. Her journey of self-discovery, artistic expression, and coping mechanisms offers a vivid illustration of Type 4 characteristics in action.

## Resilience Amidst Tragedy: Miley Cyrus's Response to Personal Loss

One of the most poignant examples of Miley's Type 4 personality shining through adversity came in 2018 when she faced a significant personal loss.

Miley and her then-fiancé Liam Hemsworth lost their Malibu home in the devastating California wildfires. This house wasn't just a structure; it was a sanctuary filled with memories and treasures that represented a significant chapter in Miley's life.

The timing of this loss was particularly striking. Miley was in the midst of filming an episode of "Black Mirror" when she received news of the fire. In a display of resilience and professionalism that's characteristic of many Type 4s when they're invested in their work, Miley continued filming the next day, even shooting a music video for the episode. She explained her decision with the age-old showbiz adage, **"The show must go on."**

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@mileycyrus/video/7275325888546245918" data-video-id="7275325888546245918" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@mileycyrus" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mileycyrus?refer=embed">@mileycyrus</a> <p>Used To Be Young (Series) - PART 36</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Used To Be Young - Miley Cyrus" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Used-To-Be-Young-7270927725950076930?refer=embed">♬ Used To Be Young - Miley Cyrus</a> </section> </blockquote>

This experience and Miley's response to it illuminate several key aspects of her Type 4 personality:

1. **Emotional Depth**: Type 4s feel emotions intensely, and the loss of her home would have hit Miley hard. In an <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/miley-cyrus-filming-black-mirror-malibu-house-burned-down-anxiety-attacks-1235584022/">interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Miley revealed that the experience triggered anxiety attacks, showcasing the depth of her emotional response.

2. **Finding Meaning in Suffering**: Type 4s often seek to find deeper meaning in their pain. Miley's decision to continue working despite her personal tragedy could be seen as an attempt to create something meaningful out of her suffering.

3. **Authenticity in Crisis**: Even in the face of loss, Miley remained true to herself and her commitments. This authenticity in crisis is a hallmark of healthy Type 4s.

4. **Resilience and Creativity**: By channeling her emotions into her work on "Black Mirror," Miley demonstrated the Type 4's ability to use creativity as a coping mechanism.

5. **Embracing Change**: The loss of her home marked a significant change in Miley's life. Type 4s, while often nostalgic, also have a capacity to embrace change as part of their journey of self-discovery.

In the aftermath of the fire, Miley reflected on the experience in her music. In her song "Slide Away," which many believe to be about her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, she sings:

> "Once upon a time, it was paradise
> Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
> Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
> But it's time to let it go"

These lyrics encapsulate the Type 4's ability to find poetic beauty in loss and change. They reflect a deep emotional processing of the event and its impact on her life and relationships.

This experience, while traumatic, became another chapter in Miley's ongoing story of self-discovery and resilience. It showcases how Type 4s, like Miley, can face adversity head-on, using their emotional depth and creativity to process and grow from even the most challenging experiences.
