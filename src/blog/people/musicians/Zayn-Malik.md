Zayn's selective sharing of his personal life, particularly his relationship with Gigi Hadid, reflects the Type 4's desire to maintain a sense of mystery and depth in their connections.

## Navigating Fame: The Type 4 Individualist's Struggle in Zayn Malik's Career

Type 4s often struggle with feelings of melancholy and a fear of being ordinary. Zayn's approach to his career reflects this:
