Here’s the **foundational Phase 1 research** based on concrete evidence—quotes, behaviors, and patterns—to begin building Greta Thunberg’s Enneagram Type 1 psychological profile.

---

## 🔹 1. Core Motivations & Deepest Fears

### 🎙️ Direct Quotes

- **“And I am sorry, but saying everything will be all right while continuing doing nothing at all is just not hopeful… You can’t just sit around waiting for hope to come… hope is something you have to earn.”** (“No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference”) ([goodreads.com][1])

  - _Reveals a drive for tangible action over empty promises—common in Type 1’s need for integrity and responsibility._

- **“We can’t save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed… Everything needs to change – and it has to start today.”** (TEDx Stockholm, Nov 2018) ([en.wikipedia.org][2])

  - _Demonstrates her perfectionist, corrective attitude—“rules” aren’t good enough until they’re right._

### Behavioral Pattern

- At age 15, organized the first **school strike for climate** (Aug 2018), starting entirely **alone**, refusing to be deterred by peer indifference ([glamour.com][3]).

  - _Her decision to act solely (“I’m going to do this alone”) underscores internal moral compulsion and fear of failing to do what is right._

---

## 🔹 2. Core Emotion Relationship (Anger/Shame)

### 🎙️ Handling Criticism

- **“When haters go after your looks and differences… you know you’re winning!”** (Instagram, Aug 2019) ([teenvogue.com][4], [bbc.co.uk][5])

  - _Reframes attack as sign of moral clarity rather than insecurity—a Type 1 hallmark of turning shame or attack into moral high ground._

- **“That happens all the time… The most common criticism… I’m being manipulated… I can’t think for myself… And I think that is so annoying!... I’m sure you hear that a lot… when I see all the hate… I honestly can’t believe how you manage to stay so strong.”** (Guardian interview, June 2019) ([quotepark.com][6])

  - _Acknowledges criticism and annoyance, but also self-awareness and defiance rooted in inner conviction._

### 🎙️ Emotional Expression

- UN 2019 speech (“**How dare you!**”) Jan 23, 2019: **“This is all wrong… You have stolen my dreams and my childhood…”** ([en.wikipedia.org][2])

  - _Highly charged, righteous anger toward inaction, consistent with the “anger at corruption” of Type 1 under stress._

---

## 🔹 3. Intelligence Type Manifestation

### 🧠 Intellectual

- Consistently **cites scientific data** (e.g., IPCC carbon budgets—Chapter 2, page 108) during speeches ([rianswart.co.za][7], [newyorker.com][8]).

  - _Indicates objective reasoning and structured, truth-based argumentation._

### 💗 Emotional

- Shows **empathy** for future generations: “The eyes of all future generations are upon you…” ([bbc.co.uk][5]).

  - _Caring for others through moral standards is typical of Type 1’s emotional engagement._

### 🦅 Instinctual

- Immediate, gut-driven responses, e.g.: sailing emissions-free rather than flying—an instinctual moral act even when inconvenient ([glamour.com][3]).

---

## 1. 🚨 Major Life Challenges

### A. 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla (June 2025)

- Launched aboard the _Madleen_ to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza despite high risk ([people.com][1], [en.wikipedia.org][2]).
- **Quote (launch, June 1, 2025):**

  > “We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying.” ([apnews.com][3])
  > _Behavior:_ Emotional, tearful speech—revealing moral urgency and commitment amid danger.

- **Interception & Detention (June 9–10, 2025):**

  - Described Israeli boarding as “kidnapping” and illegal under international law ([en.wikipedia.org][2], [theguardian.com][4]).
  - Upon deportation, said: “Doing nothing is not an option, I am terrified by the passivity and silence all over the world...” ([thetimes.co.uk][5]).
  - Responded to Trump’s criticism with: “I think the world needs a lot more young angry women…” ([reuters.com][6]).

_Enneagram insight:_ Demonstrates Type 1’s moral urgency and activist responsibility under external crisis; frames inaction as unethical. Publicly resists authority actions she sees as unjust.

### B. Public Backlash & Criticism (2023–2025)

- Faced criticism for showing solidarity with Palestinians; accused of politicization and antisemitism .
- Israeli authorities labeled her actions a “media provocation” and revoked access ([thetimes.co.uk][5]).
- Greta defended: “If you have any sense of humanity left… there's no option but to stand with Palestine.” ([tiktok.com][7]).

_Behavior:_ Strong moral framing with “no option but to stand,” rejecting reputational risk.

---

## 2. 💼 Career & Activism-Specific Pressures

### A. Public Figures & Critics

- Donald Trump called her “strange” and “angry”; she retorted, “the world needs more young angry women…” ([reuters.com][6]).
- Israeli Foreign Ministry dismissed her as “Instagram activism,” prompting her to highlight genocide and injustice ([thetimes.co.uk][5]).

### B. Media Pressure

- Global media intensely scrutinized the Flotilla mission; Thunberg faced conference embarrassment due to radical associations ([de.wikipedia.org][8]).
- She chose limited personal criticism response, focusing instead on structural injustice.

---

## 3. 💪 Coping Mechanisms & Recovery

- **Public accountability framing:** She labels oppression, injustice, and inaction as moral failure rather than personal defeat.
- **Resilience through purpose:** Despite detention, remains committed—“there will be a march to Gaza,” “not the end” ([reddit.com][9]).
- **Reframing conflict as moral opportunity:** When criticized, she amplifies moral clarity (“more angry women”) instead of retreating.

_Enneagram insight:_ Classic Type 1 defense—channeling upset into moral framing and righteous action, externally focused rather than self-focused.

---

## 4. 🧭 Psychological Dynamics Under Pressure

| Challenge                      | Response Style                                        | Enneagram Theme                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adversarial boarding (Madleen) | Public confrontation; legal framing (“kidnapping”)    | Type 1’s moral black/white worldview, truth-speaking   |
| Deportation                    | Strategic refusal to sign; maintains moral clarity    | Integrity, refusal to yield to injustice               |
| Criticism from global leaders  | Reframed as call for systemic moral awakening         | Deflection through higher moral purpose                |
| Continued advocacy post-crisis | Announces future solidarity actions (“march to Gaza”) | Integration: purpose-driven resilience (Type 1→7 path) |

---

## ✅ Phase 6 Summary

- **Major crises**: Gaza flotilla, legal declaration, confrontation with global powers.
- **Psychological impact**: Heightened moral resolve despite real threats.
- **Coping**: Framing inaction as unethical, reinforcing activists’ resolve, future-oriented planning.
- **Resilience pattern**: Emotional intensity → moral framing → continued activism.

---

### 🧠 Final Enneagram Type 1 Profile Synthesis

Greta’s responses during crises mirror Type 1’s deepest fears (failure, moral decay) and highest motivations (integrity, justice). Under pressure, she intensifies moral clarity, embraces activism as a form of duty, and uses crisis as opportunity for righteous action rather than retreat—exemplifying the reformer’s journey toward resilience and integration.
