## 9/11: Validation of a Type 6's Worst Fears

George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, is a strong example of an Enneagram Type 6, the Loyalist. The tragic events of September 11, 2001, shook the world and confirmed Bush's worst fears about national security. As a Type 6, he likely felt a heightened sense of anxiety and concern for the safety of the nation. This incident propelled him to take decisive action, demonstrating his commitment to protecting America and its citizens from further harm.

## The Iraq War: A Fear-Driven Response to Potential Threats

One of the most significant and controversial decisions of George W. Bush's presidency was the invasion of Iraq in 2003. This decision, rooted in the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, reflects a Type 6's need for security and desire to eliminate perceived threats. Though no weapons were ultimately found, this preemptive strike illustrates Bush's determination to act on his fears and protect the United States from potential harm.

## The Patriot Act: Gathering Information to Alleviate Fear

Another example of Bush's Type 6 characteristics is the implementation of the Patriot Act, which expanded the government's surveillance capabilities in the name of national security. This legislation, enacted shortly after the 9/11 attacks, demonstrates Bush's desire to gather as much information as possible to reduce his own fear and anxiety. While the Patriot Act has faced criticism for its potential infringement on civil liberties, it underscores Bush's commitment to assuaging his fears through knowledge and control.

## Loyalty to Family: A Hallmark of the Enneagram Type 6

Lastly, George W. Bush's devotion to his wife, Laura, and his close-knit family further exemplifies his Enneagram Type 6 traits. His loyalty to his loved ones, including his father, former President George H.W. Bush, is a testament to the importance of strong relationships in a Type 6's life. Bush has often credited his family's support as a driving force behind his political career, illustrating the deep sense of loyalty that defines the Loyalist personality type.

In conclusion, George W. Bush's Enneagram Type 6 tendencies are evident in his response to the 9/11 attacks, his decisions regarding the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, and his unwavering loyalty to his family. These examples illustrate the profound impact that the Enneagram can have on an individual's life and decision-making, even at the highest levels of leadership.
