<p class="firstLetter">Meghan Markle's journey has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

From Hollywood actress to British royalty to global humanitarian, her path has captivated millions worldwide. Behind the headlines and royal drama lies a personality that seems to perfectly embody the traits of an Enneagram Type 2 – The Helper.

Let's explore why.

## The Fascinating Rise of Meghan Markle

Before she was the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan was hustling in Hollywood.

She worked as a freelance calligrapher between acting gigs (a little-known fact that humanizes her journey). Her breakthrough role on "Suits" as Rachel Zane lasted seven seasons, establishing her as more than just a pretty face in the entertainment industry.

Then came the whirlwind romance with Prince Harry that transformed her life overnight.

Her story resonates with so many because it feels like a modern fairy tale – albeit one with very real challenges and consequences.

## The Core of a Type 2: The Desire to Be Needed

The defining trait of [Enneagram Type 2's](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-2) is their profound need to feel indispensable.

Twos orient their lives around helping others. They derive their sense of self-worth from being needed and making a difference in others' lives. This isn't just about being nice – it's about constructing an identity around being essential to others.

For Meghan, this pattern is startlingly clear.

Her pre-royal philanthropy wasn't casual charity work. As a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, she traveled to Rwanda to help with clean water initiatives. She wrote passionately for TIME magazine about menstrual hygiene and how it affects girls' education.

These weren't mere photo ops. They were expressions of a personality driven to make tangible differences in people's lives.

## The Megxit Mystery: A Type 2 Perspective

The dramatic royal exit – dubbed "Megxit" by the press – puzzled many observers. Why leave such a privileged position?

Through an Enneagram Type 2 lens, it makes perfect sense.

The rigid structure of royal life left Meghan with little autonomy to pursue causes she cared about. More crucially, the traditional "seen but not heard" royal role directly conflicted with her need to actively help and connect with people.

In the royal family, Meghan wasn't needed. She was merely expected to fit a predetermined mold.

For a Type 2 personality, that's emotional suffocation.

The creation of the Archewell Foundation after leaving royal duties reveals what truly drives her – the freedom to channel her energy into causes where she feels genuinely needed and effective.

## The Helper's Shadow: Image Management

Every Enneagram type has shadow aspects, and Type 2's struggle with authenticity when seeking approval.

Meghan has shown remarkable awareness of her public image. Her 2021 Oprah interview – where she discussed experiencing suicidal thoughts while pregnant – revealed both vulnerability and calculated image management.

Critics point to inconsistencies in some of her narratives as evidence of manipulation. Supporters see a woman fighting to control her own story in a hostile media environment.

The truth likely contains elements of both perspectives.

Type 2's often blur the line between authentic helping and performative gestures designed to earn love and appreciation. Their desire for connection is genuine, but their methods can sometimes prioritize appearance over substance.

## The Warmth That Wins Hearts

At their best, Type 2's radiate genuine warmth and empathy that draws people to them like magnets.

Meghan's charisma isn't just about physical beauty – it's about her ability to make others feel seen and valued.

During public engagements, she's known for making eye contact, remembering personal details, and showing authentic interest in people's stories. This natural rapport-building skill likely played a significant role in her whirlwind romance with Prince Harry.

Friends and former colleagues consistently describe her warmth and thoughtfulness. Even in her pre-royal days, she was known for writing thank-you notes and remembering birthdays – classic Type 2 behaviors that strengthen social bonds.

Her marriage to Harry shows another Type 2 trait: the ability to intuitively understand and meet the emotional needs of those they care about. Harry, who struggled with the trauma of his mother's death, found in Meghan someone who could provide the emotional support and understanding he needed.

## Daily Habits That Reflect Type 2 Values

Meghan's personal habits offer another window into her Type 2 tendencies.

Her wellness routine includes yoga and meditation – practices that help manage the stress that comes from the Type 2's tendency to prioritize others' needs over their own self-care. Her advocacy for mental health awareness mirrors the Type 2's journey toward recognizing their own needs as valid.

Even her lifestyle blog "The Tig" (named after her favorite wine, Tignanello) focused on sharing wellness tips, recipes, and travel recommendations – a digital extension of the Type 2's desire to be helpful and nurturing.

## Type 2 Under Stress: The Breaking Point

When Type 2's face extreme stress, they can shift to unhealthy behaviors associated with Type 8, becoming more aggressive and confrontational.

The intense scrutiny and racism Meghan experienced likely triggered this stress response. Her willingness to directly challenge the royal establishment and British tabloids shows this shift toward more assertive self-protection.

It's worth noting that this isn't manipulative behavior – it's a natural response when a Type 2's core need for appreciation is not just unmet but actively attacked.

## Motherhood: The Ultimate Type 2 Role

Becoming a mother to Archie and Lilibet has given Meghan the one role where being needed is guaranteed and welcomed.

Her children's book "The Bench" offers a glimpse into how she views the parent-child relationship – as a sacred space of unconditional love and presence. This aligns perfectly with the Type 2's desire to form deep, meaningful bonds where their care is essential and appreciated.

Her decision to step back from royal duties can also be understood as a protective Type 2 mother ensuring her children wouldn't face the same scrutiny and pressure she experienced.

## The Path Forward for This Type 2

As Meghan continues to shape her post-royal identity, understanding her Type 2 tendencies offers insight into where she might find greatest fulfillment.

The Archewell Foundation and her content production deals with Netflix and Spotify all align with the Type 2's desire to help, connect, and influence positive change. These ventures allow her to maintain a platform for causes she cares about while controlling her own narrative.

The challenge for any Type 2, including Meghan, is learning to help from a place of abundance rather than need – giving without expectation of validation or appreciation.

## Conclusion: Beyond the Royal Drama

Whether you admire Meghan Markle or question her motives, viewing her through the Enneagram Type 2 lens offers a more nuanced understanding of what drives her.

Behind the glamour, titles, and controversy stands a woman whose core motivation – to be loved through being needed – explains much of her journey from actress to duchess to independent humanitarian.

Her story reminds us that even those in the most privileged positions still grapple with the basic human need for connection, purpose, and understanding.
