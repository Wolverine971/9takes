<p class="firstLetter">Meghan Markle's transformation from struggling actress to controversial royal figure has captivated millions worldwide.</p>

But what drives her?

What makes her tick?

The answer may lie in understanding her as an [Enneagram Type 2 personality](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-2).

## Meghan Markle Before Royal Life: From Suits Actress to Global Celebrity

Before becoming the **Duchess of Sussex** and entering the royal spotlight, Meghan hustled hard in Hollywood.

She worked odd jobs as a freelance calligrapher between auditions. She fought for bit parts. She smiled through rejection after rejection, building the resilience that would serve her well later.

Then came _Suits_ – seven seasons as Rachel Zane that established her as more than just another pretty face in the entertainment industry. But it was her whirlwind romance with [Prince Harry](/personality-analysis/Prince-Harry) that transformed her into a global figure overnight.

Their fairy-tale royal wedding in Windsor Castle in 2018 seemed like the beginning of a charmed life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Instead, it was the start of a tumultuous journey that would ultimately lead the couple to break with the British monarchy entirely.

_Why?_ The answer lies in understanding Meghan's core personality.

## Meghan Markle Personality Analysis: Why the Duchess of Sussex Is a Classic Type 2

The Enneagram Type 2, often called "The Helper," has one overwhelming desire: **to feel indispensable to others**.

Type 2s build their identity around being essential to people they care about. They derive self-worth from making tangible differences in others' lives. This isn't casual do-gooderism—it's a fundamental need that shapes their entire worldview.

For Meghan, this pattern has been strikingly consistent throughout her life.

Before she ever met Prince Harry, she was deeply involved in humanitarian work. As a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, she traveled to Rwanda for clean water initiatives. She wrote passionately for TIME magazine about menstrual hygiene and girls' education.

"_I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches; I've always wanted to be a woman who works_," Meghan once said. This perfectly captures the Type 2's need to be actively making a difference rather than passively existing.

## Why Did Meghan Markle Leave the Royal Family? The Enneagram Explains Megxit

When Meghan and Harry announced their decision to step back from royal duties in 2020 (dubbed "Megxit" by the British press), many were baffled. Why would the **Duchess of Sussex** leave such a privileged position within the British monarchy?

Through an Enneagram Type 2 lens, it makes perfect sense.

The rigid structure of royal life left Meghan with little autonomy to pursue causes she cared about. The traditional "seen but not heard" royal protocol directly conflicted with her Type 2 need to actively help and connect with people.

In the royal family, Meghan wasn't needed for her unique talents and perspective—she was merely expected to fit a predetermined mold established by centuries of tradition.

For a Type 2 personality, that's emotional suffocation. The role stripped her of the very thing that gives her identity: the ability to help others in meaningful ways of her choosing.

Their creation of the Archewell Foundation after leaving royal duties reveals what truly drives the Duchess—the freedom to channel her energy into causes where she feels genuinely needed and effective, from mental health advocacy to gender equality initiatives.

## Meghan Markle Netflix Show Reviews: 'With Love, Meghan' and the Helper's Need to Connect

Meghan's recent Netflix show "With Love, Meghan" has faced significant backlash and mixed reviews. Released in March 2025, the lifestyle series initially broke into the top ten streaming lists but has since fallen in the rankings with low ratings on platforms like IMDb.

Despite this, Meghan thanked fans on Instagram, writing: "_For more recipes, fun and reasons to 'Mmmm', check out the show - which in just 24 hours is already in the Top 10!_"

This showcases classic Type 2 behavior—focusing on the positive connections made rather than criticism received. Her desire to share lifestyle tips and create a warm, hospitable space reflects the Type 2's natural inclination to nurture others, even through a screen.

The backlash to the show highlights a common challenge for Type 2s: the gap between their intentions (to help and connect) and how others may perceive their actions (as inauthentic or self-serving).

## Kate Middleton vs Meghan Markle: Why the Royal Conflict Happened According to Enneagram

Recent reports have highlighted contrasting approaches between the **Duchess of Sussex** and Kate Middleton (now Princess of Wales) in adapting to royal life.

Former palace staffers have suggested that while both women faced similar challenges including "backbiting gossipy criticism," Kate accepted royal protocols as "an essential part of being a member of the Royal Family," while Meghan viewed the same treatment as being "pushed around."

This perfectly illustrates how Meghan's Type 2 Enneagram characteristics influenced her experience of royal life. Type 2s need to feel their unique contributions are valued—they're helpers by nature, but they need autonomy in how they express that helping.

The conflict between Kate and Meghan wasn't simply about personality clashes as often portrayed in tabloids. From an Enneagram perspective, it reflects a fundamental difference in how they processed royal expectations. Kate, who reportedly has a different Enneagram type, was able to find fulfillment within the traditional royal framework, while Meghan's Type 2 nature rebelled against constraints that prevented her from helping on her own terms.

This tension has continued into 2025, with recent reports suggesting Kate has been "clearly opposed to any attempt at reconciliation between Meghan Markle and the royal family," viewing Meghan's presence as "a significant obstacle to the harmony the monarchy needs."

## Is Meghan Markle a Narcissist? Understanding the Duchess of Sussex's True Personality

Every Enneagram type has shadow aspects, and Type 2s struggle with authenticity when seeking approval.

Meghan has shown remarkable awareness of her public image. Her 2021 Oprah interview—where she discussed experiencing suicidal thoughts while pregnant—revealed both vulnerability and calculated image management.

So is the **Duchess of Sussex** a narcissist, as search trends and media headlines frequently suggest?

**No**—but the question reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of both clinical narcissism and Type 2 Enneagram personalities.

What critics perceive as Meghan's "narcissism" is actually a manifestation of Type 2 traits under extreme stress. Type 2s often blur the line between authentic helping and performative gestures designed to earn appreciation. Their desire for connection is genuine, but their methods can sometimes prioritize appearance over substance when their core needs aren't met.

This behavior stems from the Type 2's deepest fear: being unlovable for who they truly are. When this fear was triggered—as it was during Meghan's time in the royal family—she may have become more image-conscious and self-protective in an attempt to secure the validation she needed.

Psychologist Jo Hemmings noted that Meghan has "a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutiful life she signed up to," but this is better understood as a Type 2 under stress rather than clinical narcissism.

Meghan's apparent self-righteousness stems not from pathological narcissism but from a Type 2's genuine belief in their good intentions and difficulty acknowledging shortcomings when their core need for appreciation isn't met. Her reference to herself as "Duchess of Sussex" even after leaving royal duties reflects this Type 2 need for identity validation rather than narcissistic entitlement.

## Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Relationship: How a Type 6 and Type 2 Create a Powerful Bond

The relationship between Meghan, **Duchess of Sussex**, and Prince Harry offers fascinating insight into a powerful Enneagram pairing: a Type 2 (Helper) married to a [Type 6 (Loyalist)](/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-6).

While Meghan as a Type 2 derives fulfillment from being needed, Harry as a Type 6 is characterized by unwavering loyalty, commitment to security, and a deep fear of abandonment—traits undoubtedly shaped by the traumatic loss of his mother, Princess Diana.

Type 6 individuals like Harry are the most loyal of all Enneagram types. They seek security and stability but are constantly aware of potential threats. Once they commit their loyalty, especially to a partner, they become fierce protectors and advocates. This explains Harry's unflinching defense of Meghan against media criticism and his willingness to break with his family to protect her.

As a Type 6, Harry would have been particularly sensitive to any perceived attacks on Meghan. Body language experts noted that in their engagement interview, Harry looked like "a guy that almost can't believe his luck," while Meghan appeared confident and reassuring—perfectly illustrating their complementary dynamic.

This Type 2-Type 6 pairing creates a powerful bond: Meghan satisfies Harry's need for unwavering support and emotional safety, while Harry's fierce loyalty and protection fulfill Meghan's desire to be essential to someone. Their decision to leave the royal family showcases this dynamic perfectly—Harry's Type 6 loyalty to Meghan overrode even his lifelong loyalty to the monarchy when he perceived it as a threat to her wellbeing.

## Meghan Markle as a Mother: How Archie and Lilibet Fulfill Her Type 2 Desires

Becoming a mother to Archie and Lilibet has given Meghan the one role where being needed is guaranteed and welcomed.

Her children's book "The Bench" offers a glimpse into how she views the parent-child relationship—as a sacred space of unconditional love and presence. This aligns perfectly with the Type 2's desire to form deep, meaningful bonds where their care is essential and appreciated.

Her decision to step back from royal duties can also be understood as a protective Type 2 mother ensuring her children wouldn't face the same scrutiny and pressure she experienced.

## Meghan Markle Lifestyle Brand: How The Tig and 'As Ever' Express Her Helper Tendencies

Meghan's personal habits offer another window into her Type 2 tendencies.

Her wellness routine includes yoga and meditation—practices that help manage the stress that comes from the Type 2's tendency to prioritize others' needs over their own self-care. Her advocacy for mental health awareness mirrors the Type 2's journey toward recognizing their own needs as valid.

Even her lifestyle blog "The Tig" (named after her favorite wine, Tignanello) focused on sharing wellness tips, recipes, and travel recommendations—a digital extension of the Type 2's desire to be helpful and nurturing.

## Why Meghan Markle Left Britain: A Type 2 Under Royal Pressure

When Type 2s face extreme stress, they can shift to unhealthy behaviors associated with Type 8, becoming more aggressive and confrontational.

The intense scrutiny and racism Meghan experienced likely triggered this stress response. Her willingness to directly challenge the royal establishment and British tabloids shows this shift toward more assertive self-protection.

It's worth noting that this isn't manipulative behavior—it's a natural response when a Type 2's core need for appreciation is not just unmet but actively attacked.

## Meghan Markle's Future Projects: How the Duchess of Sussex Will Express Her Type 2 Nature

As Meghan continues to shape her post-royal identity, understanding her Type 2 tendencies offers insight into where she might find greatest fulfillment.

The Archewell Foundation and her content production deals with Netflix and Spotify all align with the Type 2's desire to help, connect, and influence positive change. These ventures allow her to maintain a platform for causes she cares about while controlling her own narrative.

Her recent "As Ever" lifestyle brand launch further demonstrates her desire to share aspects of herself that can help others, from recipes to wellness tips.

The challenge for any Type 2, including Meghan, is learning to help from a place of abundance rather than need—giving without expectation of validation or appreciation.

## Meghan Markle's True Character: Beyond Media Criticism and Royal Controversies

Whether you admire Meghan Markle or question her motives, viewing her through the Enneagram Type 2 lens offers a more nuanced understanding of what drives her.

Behind the glamour, titles, and controversy stands a woman whose core motivation—to be loved through being needed—explains much of her journey from actress to duchess to independent humanitarian.

Her story reminds us that even those in the most privileged positions still grapple with the basic human need for connection, purpose, and understanding.

_The warmth and empathy that draw people to her, the desire to make tangible differences in others' lives, the struggle when her helping isn't appreciated—these aren't calculated tactics but expressions of her fundamental nature as a Helper._
