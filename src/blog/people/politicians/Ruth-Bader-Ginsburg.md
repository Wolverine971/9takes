Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late Supreme Court Justice, was a person of impeccable integrity, a tireless fighter for justice, and a role model for many. Her remarkable life and career are a testament to the virtues and qualities of Enneagram Type 1, the Reformer. In this blog, we'll explore how and why RBG exemplifies the traits of a Type 1 and what we can learn from her.

## Perfectionism

Enneagram Type 1s are known for their perfectionism, high standards, and a strong sense of right and wrong. RBG embodied these traits throughout her career, whether it was advocating for gender equality, fighting for civil rights, or delivering opinions on the Supreme Court. She was famous for her meticulous preparation and attention to detail, and her unwavering commitment to fairness and justice.

One example of her perfectionism is the way she prepared for oral arguments. She would read every brief, every relevant statute, and every case cited by both sides. She would then prepare a detailed outline of her questions, ensuring that each question was carefully crafted to elicit the information she needed to make an informed decision. Her preparation was so thorough that her colleagues often relied on her questions to guide their own thinking.

## Idealism

Another hallmark of Enneagram Type 1s is their idealism and vision of a better world. RBG's vision was of a world where gender equality was a reality, where the law protected the rights of all, and where justice was blind. Her idealism was the driving force behind her activism and her judicial philosophy.

RBG's idealism was evident in her advocacy work before she joined the Supreme Court. She founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union and argued several landmark cases that established legal protections against gender discrimination. Her idealism was also evident in her opinions on the Supreme Court, where she often wrote eloquently about the need for equal justice under the law.

## Sense of Duty

Enneagram Type 1s have a strong sense of duty and responsibility. They feel a deep obligation to make the world a better place, to correct injustices, and to uphold the highest standards of behavior. RBG was the embodiment of this sense of duty, devoting her life to fighting for justice and equality.

RBG's sense of duty was evident in her work on the Supreme Court, where she was known for her dedication and hard work. She would often work late into the night, reading briefs and writing opinions. She also took her role as a mentor to young lawyers very seriously, and was known for her generosity in sharing her time and expertise.

## Self-Control

Finally, Enneagram Type 1s are known for their self-control, discipline, and ability to delay gratification. RBG embodied these qualities throughout her life, from her days as a law student to her tenure on the Supreme Court. She was known for her measured and thoughtful approach to decision-making, and for her ability to stay focused and calm under pressure.

One example of RBG's self-control is the way she approached her cancer treatments. Despite her advanced age and multiple health issues, she refused to step down from the Court or to slow down her work. Instead, she continued to work tirelessly, even while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Her self-discipline and determination were an inspiration to many.
