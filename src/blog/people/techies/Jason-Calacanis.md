## Jason Calacanis: An Embodiment of The Achiever?

Internationally recognized entrepreneur, angel investor, and host of the "This Week in Startups" podcast, Jason Calacanis, has left an indelible imprint on the tech industry. But what could be the driving force behind his accomplishments? Could it be an inherent yearning to feel valuable and worthwhile, characteristic of the Enneagram Type 3 - The Achiever?

### The Achiever: An Overview

Type 3s, or Achievers, are characterized by their desire for success, ambition, and competency. They embody the best in a culture, often serving as role models that inspire others to greater personal achievements. However, they are also driven by their basic fear of worthlessness. Their pursuit of success is a quest for affirmation, a desire to be admired, to distinguish themselves from others, and to have their value validated.

When stressed or disintegrated, Threes may become disengaged and apathetic, akin to an unhealthy Nine. On the other hand, when they are growing or integrated, Threes become more cooperative and committed to others, much like healthy Sixes.

## Jason Calacanis: Tracing The Achiever's Path

In Calacanis' journey, we can observe the hallmark qualities of a Type 3. His entrepreneurial success stories, from Weblogs Inc to Mahalo, stand testament to his ambition and competence. He is a self-proclaimed "hustler," striving relentlessly towards his goals, embodying the Achiever's drive for advancement.

### The Charmer and The Professional

In his interpersonal relationships and public persona, Calacanis often displays the charm and diplomacy associated with Threes. He manages to create an impression, whether it's through his assertive statements on Twitter or the charisma he displays in his podcast.

A Three with a Two-Wing, often referred to as "The Charmer," is known for their warmth, ambition, and people-pleasing tendencies. While a Three with a Four-Wing, termed "The Professional," balances their ambition with a sense of individualism and introspection. Calacanis seems to oscillate between these two sides, embodying the outgoing charisma of a "Charmer" and the professional composure of a "Professional." No where is this more evident than in the way he describes building his network.

## Beyond The Glittering Image

While the Achiever in Calacanis is evident, it's essential to acknowledge the challenges that come with this Enneagram type. Threes, in their pursuit of success, can become overly concerned with their image and disconnected from their true feelings. In some instances, Calacanis' competitiveness and workaholism have been subjects of debate. These tendencies mirror the Achiever's potential pitfalls, highlighting the importance of introspection and authenticity in maintaining balance.

### The Journey Towards Self-Acceptance

Nevertheless, Calacanis' journey also provides a fascinating glimpse into the Achiever's path towards growth. As he embarks on new ventures and evolves his persona, he is inching closer to the integrated or healthy state of a Type 3, marked by self-acceptance and authenticity.

## How Jason's enneagram type can be seen influencing his work

Jason's first major triumph, co-founding Weblogs Inc., is indicative of the ambitious, competent nature of Type 3. The way he later leveraged his skills and insights as an angel investor, scoring wins with companies like Uber, further showcases his goal-oriented mindset and knack for achievement.

Calacanis consistently states that hard work is the key to his success, a statement that echoes Type 3's tendency towards workaholism. However, it's his flexibility and determination where we truly see the Type 3 shine. When his venture, Mahalo, struggled, he didn't give up. Instead, he transformed it into a successful YouTube video content provider, Inside.com, demonstrating Type 3's adaptive, success-focused nature.

Furthermore, through his popular podcast, "This Week in Startups," Calacanis exemplifies a Type 3's charm and charisma. His ability to captivate audiences, motivate, and inspire others aligns with the natural leadership and charm commonly seen in this Enneagram type.

## Jason's impact on "The All in Podcast"

Jason Calacanis's influence on "The All In Podcast" is a testament to his Enneagram Type 3 personality traits of ambition, adaptability, and a knack for achievement. As the moderator, he skillfully manages the ideological spectrum, facilitating dynamic discussions while maintaining the harmony and camaraderie among the hosts.

His self-proclaimed title as the 'world's greatest moderator' underpins his Type 3's desire for achievement and recognition. He artfully directs the conversation, providing each participant with an opportunity to express their views, demonstrating his adaptability, a key trait of Type 3.

The playful tension between Calacanis and Sacks adds a unique dynamic to the podcast, showcasing Jason's charm and charisma, characteristic of his Enneagram type. His firm stance on his beliefs reflects his determination and persistence, while his ability to shift from serious debates to laughter underscores his flexibility.

There's an underlying ambition within Jason that once resulted in him being jokingly accused of trying to take over the podcast, indicative of the Type 3's desire for success. Yet his respect for the team dynamic and focus on their friendship shows a healthy ability to manage this ambition, further illustrating his Type 3 traits.

In essence, Jason's Enneagram Type 3 personality deeply informs his role and impact on "The All In Podcast," balancing ambition, adaptability, and a drive for recognition, creating a captivating dynamic that fuels the show's success.
