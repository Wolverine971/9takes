<p class="firstLetter">We are all the stars in our narratives. We are all driven to succeed, some more than others.</p> 

Jason Calcanis is one of those people who cannot stand to be anything but the epitome of success in everything he does. He is aching to make a mark and is willing to reinvent himself again and again to accomplish his goals. Jason is an Enneagram type 3, also known as "The Achiever."

 Here, we will explain what that looks like.

## Jason Calacanis: An Embodiment of The Achiever?

Jason is an angel investor and the host of the two prominent podcasts "<a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thisweekin" >This Week in Startups</a>" and the "All in". He also runs a startup accelerator called "Founder University" and hosts another podcast called the "All-In" podcast. To say Jason is busy would be an understatement. He prides himself on his hard work and encourages the founders he mentors to work just as hard.

Why does Jason feel the need to work so hard? Is it because he loves making the world a better place? Or is it because he would feel worthless if he was not successful? The answer is the latter.

### The Achiever: An Overview

Type 3s, or Achievers, are characterized by their desire for success and relentless pursuit of their goals and ambitions. They embody the best of a culture, often serving as role models that inspire others to more extraordinary personal achievements. However, their need to be successful is born out of a fear of worthlessness. In another sense, they feel deep shame and are insecure that they are not worthy of love if they are unsuccessful. Somewhere in their childhood, they picked up this message, and now, every time they achieve something, it validates their value.

When they are not achieving or are very stressed, type 3s may become disengaged and lethargic and act like an unhealthy version of another personality type, the Enneagram 9. On the other hand, when they are achieving, growing, and feeling their best, Threes become more cooperative and committed to others, much like healthy Enneagram Sixes.

## Jason Calacanis: Tracing The Achiever's Path

In Jason's journey, we can observe the hallmark qualities of a Type 3. His entrepreneurial success stories, from <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblogs,_Inc." >Weblogs Inc</a> to <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalo.com" >Mahalo</a>, stand testament to his never ending ambition. He is a self-proclaimed "hustler" and beats the drum of needing to work hard relentlessly.

### The Charmer and The Professional

But Jason is not just a hard worker. If you watch him in interviews or a group setting, he is often the most charismatic person in the room. He is a master of socializing. He is good in front of a camera and frankly enjoys being on camera. Did we mention that he hosts two podcasts?

The thing about 3s is that they have a superpower. Hard work is not their superpower. A three's superpower is their ability to read a room and read the emotions and body language of anyone they come in contact with. They can sense what you think and feel about them and use that highly tuned people's reading to their advantage. With that intuition, they can become the person they would like and admire if they so choose. Naturally charismatic people do this, but 3s have finely tuned this people reading ability since they were young, and so has Jason.

## Beyond The Glittering Image

While the Achiever in Calacanis is evident, it's essential to acknowledge the challenges of this Enneagram type. Threes, in their pursuit of success, can become overly concerned with their image and disconnected from their true feelings. In some instances, Jason's competitiveness and workaholism have rubbed people the wrong way. These tendencies mirror the Achiever's potential pitfalls, highlighting the importance of introspection and authenticity in maintaining balance.

### The Journey Towards Self-Acceptance

Nevertheless, Calacanis' journey also provides a fascinating glimpse into the Achiever's path toward growth. As he embarks on new ventures and evolves his persona, he is inching closer to the integrated or healthy state of Type 3, marked by self-acceptance and authenticity.

## How Jason's enneagram type can be seen influencing his work

Jason started as a reporter talking about the <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis">"internet industry."</a>After the dot-com boom, he worked his way up to becoming a startup founder. Jason's first major triumph was co-founding Weblogs Inc., where he got an investment from Mark Cuban and sold it two years later. He kept upping the anti and later leveraged his skills and insights as an angel investor, scoring wins with companies like Uber. Jason was on a steep incline of growth, showcasing his goal-oriented mindset and knack for achievement.

Nowadays, he works on his popular podcast, "This Week in Startups," where Calacanis exemplifies a Type 3's charm and charisma. His ability to captivate audiences, motivate, and inspire others aligns with the natural leadership and appeal commonly seen in this Enneagram type.

## Jason's impact on "The All in Podcast"

Jason's influence on "The All In Podcast" is a testament to his Enneagram Type 3 personality traits. He is the moderator. The self-proclaimed "world's greatest moderator." He skillfully manages the ideological spectrum, facilitating dynamic discussions while maintaining harmony and camaraderie among the hosts.

This underscores his Type 3's desire for achievement and recognition. He artfully directs the conversation, allowing each participant to express their views while always getting his 2 cents in.

The playful tension between Calacanis and David Sacks adds a unique dynamic to the podcast. Jason and Sacks started off on opposite sides of the political spectrum; however, the hostility has died down over time. Jason showcases his ability to shift from serious debates to laughter, highlighting his flexibility. They are both poker players and VCs. In the place of political competition now stands a friendship, and though he and Sacks don't always agree, Jason is loyal to his friend David Sacks and has defended him on multiple occasions.

Jason was jokingly accused of trying to take over the podcast once. There needed to be more clarity on where to take the podcast. Jason wanted to do things to grow the podcast and monetize it; however, the other podcast members wanted to keep the podcast authentic. Jason ended up focusing on the friendship between the podcasters rather than the show's success. This shows a healthy ability to manage this ambition.
