> After 9/11 Peter put a parachute in his office. - Joe Lonsdale

 <p class="firstLetter">Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech mogul known for his contrarian bets and provocative worldview, is a fascinating study in the Enneagram Type 6 personality.</p>

Beneath the headline-grabbing investments and controversial political stances lies a complex man driven by a profound need for security and a wariness of who to trust. Join us as we decode the mind of this Silicon Valley titan through the Enneagram lens.

Beneath the headlines and billion-dollar investments lies a complex man driven by a profound need for security and a wariness of who to trust. Here we dive into the psyche of this influential figure through the lens of the Enneagram, exploring how his

## The Essence of Enneagram Type 6: The Loyalist

**At the core of every Type 6 is a deep-seated need for safety and a vigilance against potential threats.** This likely stems from childhood experiences that taught 6s to be careful about who to trust.

Sometime in their childhood <a href="/enneagram-corner/enneagram-type-6">Enneagram Type 6s</a> learned that they need to be careful about who to trust. Perhaps they were betrayed or maybe they needed help and were let down, whatever the case 6s learned the lesson that they need to be wary of others. From that seed they have grown to be question everything and everyone in an attempt to find the security and safety they long for.

Peter was born in Germany and his family emigrated to the US and lived in Cleveland Ohio when he was 1. They then moved to South Africa and South West Africa where in Peter change schools 7 times.

> He attended a school in Swakopmund that required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment, such as striking students' hands with a ruler. He said this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in his support for individualism and libertarianism.
>
> -Wikipedia

**Maybe here is where Peter got his first taste of being let down by those who he was supposed to trust.** But his penchant for second guessing others and reading between the lines certainly grew as he grew.

Peter did great in school and made it to Stanford University then to Stanford Law School. He started to clerk for the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circut but he left because he saw the career path laid before him and wanted to choose another path.

He then moved to the Bay Area and at 30 years old in 1996 old he raised $1 million to establish Thiel Capital Management. Peter the VC was born and now he was free to put his contrarian thinking to work with his money on the line.

His famous interview question, **"Tell me something that's true, that almost nobody agrees with you on"** encapsulates his VC strategy and his Type 6 tendency to question conventional wisdom and seek that which is hidden.

## The Contrarian Investor: Security Through Innovation

What makes Peter Thiel a great investor is his ability to find counterintuitive truths and secrets.

He excels at holding seemingly contradictory views, a typical Enneagram Type 6 behavior. This unique perspective allows him to see opportunities where others see only risks.

Thiel's approach to venture capitalism is a perfect manifestation of his Type 6 personality. He seeks the sweet spot between security and innovation, investing in companies that are both potentially revolutionary and grounded in solid fundamentals.

**"The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them,"** Thiel has said. This statement reflects his Type 6 tendency to look beyond the obvious, always searching for the next paradigm shift that others might miss.

## The Paypal Mafia: Building a Fortress of Trust

Thiel's co-founding of PayPal is a testament to his Type 6 desire for security, particularly in the financial realm. PayPal revolutionized online payments, making e-commerce more secure for millions of users worldwide. This achievement speaks to the Type 6's ability to create systems of safety and reliability.

Interestingly, at PayPal, Thiel implemented a unique management structure where everyone was responsible for only one thing. This strategy was designed to prevent internal competition and keep people in separate lanes. As David Sacks, a member of the PayPal Mafia, once said, "**Peter's management style was to give everyone a clear, specific role and then hold them accountable for it.**"

This approach aligns perfectly with Thiel's later assertion that "<a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05/" >competition is for losers.</a>" He argues that when companies are in direct competition, all profits get competed away. This insight likely draws inspiration from his knowledge of mimetic theory, showcasing how his Type 6 mind connects seemingly unrelated concepts to form a cohesive worldview.

## Memetic Theory and Paranoia: The World Through a Type 6 Lens

Thiel's deep interest in Ren√© Girard's Mimetic Theory aligns perfectly with the Type 6's worldview. This theory, which posits that human desire is mimetic (imitative) and leads to conflict, resonates with the Type 6's inherent wariness of others' intentions.

In a Type 6 mindset, Thiel might think, **"If everyone is prone to mimetic desire, how can I stay ahead of the curve and protect myself from being copied or overtaken?"** This paranoia-tinged perspective drives his innovative thinking and contrarian approaches.

This mindset explains Thiel's emphasis on finding "secrets" - truths that are not yet widely known or accepted. It's a defensive strategy, born from the Type 6's need for security, but it's also the source of his most brilliant insights. By constantly questioning the status quo and looking for hidden truths, Thiel has positioned himself as a visionary in the tech world.

## The Search for Immortality: The Ultimate Security

Thiel's interest in life extension and his investments in anti-aging research are deeply rooted in his Type 6 fear of loss and desire for security. His involvement in experimental treatments, including the controversial idea of injecting oneself with younger people's blood, showcases the lengths to which a Type 6 might go to ensure their long-term safety and survival.

"**Death is a problem that can be solved,**" Thiel has been quoted as saying. This bold statement reflects the Type 6's tendency to view even the most fundamental aspects of existence as challenges to be overcome in the pursuit of security.

## The Political Contrarian: Making America Great Again?

Thiel's early support for [Donald Trump](/personality-analysis/Donald-Trump), before it was politically trendy, demonstrates the counter-phobic aspect of Type 6. Despite potential social and professional risks, Thiel aligned himself with a controversial figure, showcasing the Type 6's ability to go against the grain when they believe it serves a greater purpose.

It's been speculated that Thiel was instrumental in reviving Ronald Reagan's "Make America Great Again" slogan for the Trump campaign. This attention to historical detail and its potential for modern impact is typical of a Type 6's vigilant observation of often-overlooked patterns.

## Kayfabe in Politics: The Skeptic's View

Thiel's insight into the concept of "kayfabe" in politics - the idea that much of political discourse is staged, much like professional wrestling - is a classic Type 6 observation. This skepticism about the surface-level narrative and the search for deeper truths is a hallmark of the Type 6 personality.

Eric Weinstein, a friend of Thiel's, elaborates on this concept: "Kayfabe is the reality that we're all participating in, but we're pretending we're not. It's the idea that there's a public story and a private story."

Paradoxically, while Thiel champions free speech, he also helped take down the website Gawker in a lawsuit with Hulk Hogan. This apparent contradiction showcases Thiel's nuanced view on freedom of speech - he draws the line where speech causes harm. Gawker had previously outed Thiel as gay, and their business model seemed to prioritize sensationalism over ethics.

This episode highlights an often-overlooked aspect of Thiel's personality: his loyalty to friends and allies. Type 6 individuals are often community builders, valuing safety and security not just for themselves but for their circle. Thiel's actions against Gawker can be seen as a protective measure for his community, showcasing the lengths a Type 6 will go to defend their allies.

## The Loyalist's Complex Web of Relationships

Peter Thiel's relationships offer a glimpse into his complex personality. His fallout with Elon Musk during the PayPal days, where Musk was ousted while on vacation, shows the ruthless side of Thiel's business acumen. Yet, paradoxically, Thiel maintains friendships with individuals who hold opposing political views, such as Reid Hoffman and Eric Weinstein.

This ability to maintain relationships across ideological divides is a testament to the Type 6's capacity for nuanced thinking. It also reflects their desire to understand different perspectives, perhaps as a way of staying informed and secure in a complex world.

## Peter as the Loyalist's Legacy

Peter Thiel's life and career embody the Type 6's mission to create security through innovation and contrarian thinking. From his early days co-founding PayPal to his current role as an influential venture capitalist and political thinker, his actions have been driven by a deep-seated need to build a more secure future.

"**The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create,**" Thiel has said. This quote encapsulates the essence of his Type 6 personality - always searching, always questioning, and always striving to build a safer, more innovative world.

Understanding Peter Thiel through the Enneagram offers a new perspective on his motivations, struggles, and triumphs. It reminds us that behind every public figure is a complex human being, shaped by their innate personality and life experiences.

As we reflect on Peter Thiel's journey, we're invited to consider our own inner worlds. What drives us? What fears shape our decisions? And how can understanding our personality type help us navigate our path with greater self-awareness and purpose?

The Enneagram offers a window into the human psyche. Whether you're a Type 6 like Peter Thiel or any other type, exploring this system can lead to profound insights about yourself and others.
